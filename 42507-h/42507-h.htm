    <h1 class="title">A TENDERFOOT BRIDE</h1>
    <h2 id="ch01">I—FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>
    <p>
      When our train left Colorado Springs and headed out into those vast
      stretches of the prairie, which spread East like a great green ocean from
      the foot of Pike’s Peak, all the sensations of Christopher Columbus
      setting sail for a new world, and a few peculiarly my own, mingled in my
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train pounded along I stole a look at Owen. He was absorbed in the
      contemplation of a map of our new holdings. Under that calm exterior I
      suspected hidden attributes of the primitive man. Certainly there was some
      reason why Western life was to his liking, having had the chance to
      choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when we found ourselves on the platform of
      the solitary little wayside station. The train went rushing on through the
      July sunshine, as if impatient at the stop. Our fellow passengers had
      drawn their heads back from the car windows, after vainly trying to see
      what apparently sane people could find to stop for in a place like that.
      In truth, there was little—a water tank, a section house, two cottages and
      one store.
    </p>
    <p>
      A combination station-agent and baggage-man stood on the platform. Near a
      hitching rack a tall individual was waving his long arms about like a
      windmill as he beckoned us to approach. Owen picked up the bags; I trudged
      along behind with various coats and packages, stopping midway between
      platform and wagon to disengage a large tumbleweed, which had rolled
      merrily to my feet and attached itself to my skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall man took a few steps in our direction, still holding the reins in
      his hand. With one eye he gave us a greeting, while he kept the other on
      the lunging horses. He was hardly a prepossessing person at first sight,
      except for his smile. I felt that his keen black eyes had sized us up in
      one quick glance. I became blushingly conscious of being a new bride, and
      from “the East.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How-de-do? Whoa, now, Brownie. Just get in folks,—the old man had to go
      to town, so he sent me to meet you, but he’ll be back by the time we get
      to the ranch.” All this in one breath, while he helped Owen place the bags
      in the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t mind the horses; they’re plumb gentle—just a little excited now
      over the train, that’s all. Whoa now,” with decided emphasis. “Sorry, Mrs.
      Brook, hope you didn’t hurt yourself”—this last as the horses suddenly
      backed and knocked my foot off the step. “Oh, no, not at all,” I replied,
      hastily scrambling into the wagon and thanking heaven that I had landed on
      the seat before they gave an unexpected lurch forward. Owen got in beside
      the driver; the horses reared and started off. I gripped the seat and my
      hat, and fastened my eyes on the horses’ ears. When we had crossed the
      railroad and the movement was more steady, I began to “take notice” of
      things about me, and the conversation going on in the front seat reached
      me in fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver said he was called “Tex.” He was a true son of Texas, and it
      was not difficult to imagine that particles of his native soil still clung
      to him. The deep creases in his neck were so filled with dirt that he
      looked like a charcoal sketch. As he turned his face, lined and seamed, I
      saw that his chin was covered with at least a week’s growth of
      greyish-black beard. I estimated his age. He might have been fifty; very
      quick in speech and action, yet there was a subdued power about the man.
      He managed the horses easily, and I caught in his drawling speech a
      casual, half-bantering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wonder if them grips is botherin’ the Missus. Ridin’ all right?” he
      asked, turning with solicitude to see the location of the bags. As it
      happened, they were all located on top of my feet. It was Owen who removed
      them, for Tex’s attention was again engaged with Brownie, who suddenly
      landed quite outside the road. A cotton-tail had jumped from behind a
      rattleweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quit that now, Brownie. You never did have no sense.” The drawl was
      half-sarcastic. “’Pears like you ain’t never seen no rabbits before,
      ’stead a bein’ raised with ’em.” Brownie gave a little shake of her pretty
      head and crowded her long-suffering mate back into the road again. I was
      becoming very much interested. This man was a distinctly new type to me. I
      did not know then that he was the old-time cow-puncher, with an ease of
      manner a Chesterfield might have envied, and an unfailing, almost
      deferential, courtesy toward women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never shall I forget that first drive across the prairie,—not a house, not
      a tree in sight, except where the cottonwoods traced the borders of a
      waterless creek. Gently rolling hills were all about us, instead of the
      flat country I had expected to see; hills which failed to reveal anything
      when we reached the top, but yet higher hills to climb. An unexpected
      vastness seemed to extend to the very boundaries of the unknown, as we
      looked about on all sides, only to see the soft green circle of the hills,
      on which the bluest of skies gently rested, sweep about us. I felt the
      spell of unlimited space, and smiled as I thought of the tearful farewell
      of one of my bridesmaids. She had “hated” to think of my being “cooped up
      on a ranch.” “Cooped up” here, when for the first time I realized what
      unhampered freedom might mean in a country left as God had made it, with
      so little trace of man’s interference!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we came to a gate made of three strands of barbed wire, fastened
      together in the middle and attached to a stick at each end. It was a real
      gate when up, but when opened, it was a floppy invention of the Evil One,
      designed to tax the patience of a saint. The strands of wire got mixed and
      crossed and grew perceptibly shorter, so that it required superhuman
      strength and something of a disposition to get the end of the stick
      through the loop of wire, which held it in place again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gate marked the Southern boundary of the ranch, ten miles from the
      railroad station. We reached the top of a hill and looked up a long
      valley, where the creek wound its way, fringed by great cottonwood trees,
      until its source was lost behind three prominent buttes, purple in the
      haze of the late afternoon. Beyond the buttes stood Pike’s Peak,
      snow-capped and alone, guardian of the valley, the whole length of which
      it commanded. Through some peculiarity of position all the other peaks of
      the Rockies remained invisible, while this one mountain rose in majestic
      isolation from the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tex stopped the horses for a moment, and without a word pointed with the
      whip toward a clump of cottonwoods in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>“The ranch?” I asked.</p>
    <p>He nodded.</p>
    <p>
      In the beautiful valley it stood, the white fences, corrals and
      outbuildings gleaming in the sun. Nestled among the trees, planted so
      densely that only a suggestion of its white walls showed between them, was
      the house—our first home!
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drove up to the gate, a short man, with a thick beard, bustled out
      to meet us.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, here you are! Got here all right. Sorry I couldn’t meet you. Come
      right in. You must be tired settin’.” And before we quite realized that we
      had arrived, we were ushered into the house through the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, there was no front door. Two outside doors opened
      into the kitchen, one on either side, and since the kitchen was in truth
      the “living-room,” what need of a front door?
    </p>
    <p>
      A placid-faced, elderly woman greeted us, and after a few moments
      conducted us up a crooked stairway to a room under the eaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen left hastily “to look around outside,” and I followed as quickly as
      possible for I knew that if I looked around inside for any length of time,
      I should start back to the railroad station on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mr. and Mrs. Bohm had lived on the place for over thirty years in this
      house, which was the evolution of a dug-out, with many subsequent periods
      in prospect before it became a possible home. Mrs. Bohm had recently been
      having “fainting spells,” which frightened her husband into a plan to
      dispose of the ranch and live in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful ranch. Acres on acres of richest grass, a wealth of hay
      land and natural water holes,—a paradise for stock. To poor homesick me,
      this place had no suggestion of paradise. It looked run down and
      disorderly; the fences around the house were adorned with everything from
      old battered tin buckets and mowing-machine wheels to the smallest piece
      of rusty wire. Mrs. Bohm confided to me that “James liked it that way
      because everything was so handy.” There was no questioning that, but as a
      first impression it was hopeless, and my heart grew heavier and heavier as
      I thought of the new house in Wyoming, where we had expected to be, and
      the Eastern home I had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked out of sight of the festooned fence and tried to think. Up the
      valley the Peak was deep blue against the golden evening sky, and in the
      vast, unbroken silence of the prairies I felt the sense of chaos and
      confusion give way to peace. The old house, tumble-down fences, mowing
      machine wheels and wire took an inconsequent place in the scale of things
      compared to Owen’s undertaking. He <i>must</i> succeed. The undesirable
      could be removed or made over. We were in a new world, we had a great
      domain, we faced undreamed of experiences and possibilities. My spirits
      rose with a bound, and I resolved from that moment to consider our life
      here in the West, in the midst of new conditions, a great adventure. At
      that instant the original Bohm dug-out would have held no terrors for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if I had known just how great the adventure was to be, what varied
      and nerve-testing experiences the future did hold, I might have been
      daunted; but with a farewell look at the Peak and a new sense of strength
      and courage, I went to meet Owen. I realized that he knew the
      possibilities of the place and that the conditions would all soon be
      changed, and I knew, too, that he was distressed at the realization of how
      it must all appear to me. He looked troubled, as he came toward me.
    </p>
    <p>“Can you stand it for a little while?” he asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Of course, I can,” I replied, cheerfully, blindly taking the first step
      toward the great adventure.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s all right, dear; it’s going to be wonderful, living here.”</p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Bohm, Tex and six bashful cow-punchers were in the kitchen
      waiting for us before they sat down to supper. We were presented to the
      men, and in acknowledgment of the introduction received a fleeting glance
      from six pairs of diffident eyes and a quick jerk from six slickly brushed
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bohm took her seat at the foot of the long oil-cloth-covered table,
      and old Mr. Bohm sat at the head. Fortunate for me that Owen and I sat
      side by side. If once during that meal I had caught his eye, I should have
      disgraced myself forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except old Bohm, no one said anything. Indeed, no one had a chance, for he
      talked all the time, telling stories, cracking jokes at which he laughed
      immoderately, interspersing his conversation with waves of his fork, with
      which from time to time he reflectively combed his beard. I could not take
      my eyes off him; there was a weird fascination in following the movements
      of that fork. It was prescience which led me to do so, for old Bohm
      suddenly ceased using it as a toilet article and jabbed it into a piece of
      meat, which he held out toward me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, Mrs. Brook, have some more beef. I’ve been talkin’ along here and
      clean forgot you folks must be hungry.” I assured him I couldn’t eat
      another bite. It was the most truthful statement of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I lay awake for hours, thinking over the day’s experiences, and
      incidentally trying to find a spot on the mattress where a lump did not
      threaten to press a rib out of place. At last I fell asleep, to be
      suddenly awakened by the slam of a gate under our window, followed by an
      exclamation which floated up out of the grey dawn: “By hell, but this is a
      fine day.” Then came the squeak of the pump handle, as old Bohm performed
      his morning ablutions, more slams of the gate, and more salutations of the
      same order in varying phraseology, but always beginning with “By hell.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Shades of my ministerial ancestors! Was this the language of the new
      country in which we had come to live? Surely the great adventure promised
      startling sensations at the outset, to say nothing of a certain sliding
      scale of standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen stirred and asked sleepily what on earth I was doing up at that hour
      of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Changing my viewpoint,” I replied, looking out toward old Bohm’s shadowy
      figure on its way toward the corral. “That has to be done early.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch02">II—A SURPRISE PARTY</h2>
    <p>
      We were living in the land of the unexpected. Six weeks on the ranch
      demonstrated that. The possibilities for surprise were inexhaustible, and
      the probabilities innumerable and certain, if Owen happened to be away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of these occasions the cook eloped with the best rider on the
      place, more thrilling and upsetting to my peace of mind than the
      cloud-burst and flood that followed soon after. Twenty-two husky and
      hungry men wanted three square meals a day, and one inexperienced bride
      stood between them and starvation. The situation was mutually serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my need came help. Tex, our coachman on that first drive, saved the
      day. Shortly after the elopement he came in for supplies for the cow-camp.
      I was almost hidden by pans of potatoes, and was paring away endlessly. He
      was very quiet when I explained, but after supper he gathered up the
      dishes to wash them for me, looking very serious. When he had finished, he
      suddenly turned to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, Mrs. Brook, I’ve just been studyin’. Jack Brent kin cook for the
      boys out at camp all right, and if you kin stand it, I kin come in and
      cook for you. It sure got my goat to see you rastlin’ with them potatoes
      and wearin’ yourself out cookin’ for these here men.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Good old Tex! That was little short of saintly. Camp cooking where he was
      autocrat was far more to his taste. He hated “messin’ ’round where there
      was women,” as he expressed it. Here was sacrifice indeed! Tex scrubbed
      his hands until they fairly bled, enveloped himself in a large checked
      gingham apron, and proceeded to act as chef until the eloper had been
      replaced.
    </p>
    <p>Something deepened in me. I was seeing a new thing.</p>
    <p>
      Owen had been gone nearly a week. One morning I happened to be in the
      kitchen when Mrs. Bohm entered. Casually she asked Tex whether Ed More’s
      wife had left him before he went to jail, or after he got out. Half in
      joke, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercy, Mrs. Bohm, is there a man in this country, with the exception of
      Tex, who hasn’t been in jail or on the way there?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was interrupted by the slamming of a door, and Tex had vanished. Mrs.
      Bohm looked embarrassed as she replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I just hate to tell you, Mrs. Brook, and Tex would feel terrible to have
      you know; but you say such queer things sometimes, I’d better tell you now
      that Tex”—she paused a moment—“he’s only been out of the ‘pen’ himself a
      year.”
    </p>
    <p>“Tex in the penitentiary? What on earth for?” I was almost dazed.</p>
    <div class="image-center">

        <p>ROPING AND CUTTING OUT CATTLE</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      “Well, I’ll tell you.” Mrs. Bohm began the story with apparent reluctance,
      but her manner soon betrayed a certain zest. “You see, about four years
      ago Tex was workin’ for a man up on Crow Creek and took some cattle on to
      Omaha to sell for him. When he came back he never brought a cent of money,
      and told how he had been held up and robbed. Everybody believed it at
      first, then all to onct his family—they live over West—began to dress to
      kill, and Tex bought brass beds for every room in the house; then folks
      began to suspicion where he got the money, and he was sent to the Pen for
      two years.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor old Tex! Who would ever have supposed a secret longing for brass beds
      would prove his undoing? I might have guessed horses or cards, but never
      brass beds. I almost felt the breath of tragedy. She seemed sweeping by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bohm went on: “Tex’s mighty good to his family, though, and it most
      killed him when his wife went off with a Mexican sheep-herder while he was
      doin’ time. She’s back home now with the girls, but her and Tex’s
      separated. Ain’t it a fright the way women acts?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It certainly is,” I agreed, trying to reconcile my previous idea of
      convicts with having one for a cook. It was dreadfully confusing and
      disturbing. In spite of what I had just heard, I knew I trusted Tex. He
      would never steal from us, I felt sure. And my instinct told me he would
      be a true and loyal friend. There was no apparent excuse for what he had
      done, but he had paid for his moment of weakness more fully perhaps than
      anyone realized. I pondered over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he came in, with a curious, troubled expression on his face. I
      gave him the orders, as usual, with no sign of having heard of the cloud
      under which he had lived for three miserable years. Our relations were
      re-established. I could see his relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were still taking our meals in the kitchen, although the house was
      gradually being remodeled. It was Saturday evening, and we were expecting
      Owen home. There was an air of suppressed excitement among the men. One,
      and then another, bolted from the table and out of the door, returning in
      a shame-faced manner to explain that he “thought he heered somethin’.”
      Certainly Owen’s coming would never produce such a sensation, unless he
      was expected to arrive in an airship. I was more than ever mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the meal was over, there was such a general shaving—also in the
      kitchen—and such donning of red neckties, that I could not restrain my
      curiosity. I called Tex aside and asked him where they were going. He
      looked a little sheepish, as he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, we ain’t goin’ nowhere.” Then in a burst of confidence, “I don’t
      know as I’d orter tell you, but the fact is, you folks is goin’ to be
      surprised; all the folks ’round is goin’ to have a party here, and we’re
      expectin’ ’em.”
    </p>
    <p>I gasped. A sudden suspicion flashed through my mind.</p>
    <p>“Tex, did you plan this? What on earth shall I do?”</p>
    <p>
      Tex saw I was really troubled. “Why, Mrs. Brook,” he said, “you don’t have
      to do nothin’. Just turn the house over to ’em, and along about midnight
      I’ll make some coffee—they’ll bring baskets.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was relieved to know that they only wanted the house, and would provide
      their own refreshments, for it was appalling to be an impromptu hostess to
      an entire community and to speculate upon the possibility of one small
      cold roast and chocolate cake satisfying a crowd of young people, after
      drives of thirty miles or more across the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Me and the boys”—Tex spoke somewhat apologetically, as he started toward
      the door—“we kind a thought maybe you and Mr. Brook would like to get
      acquainted, seem’s how you’re goin’ to live here; but I guess we oughten
      to have did what we done.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt ashamed of my momentary perturbation, as the force of that last
      sentence of Tex’s reached me. These men of the plains were as simple and
      sensitive as children about many things. They would really grieve if they
      felt this affair, planned solely on our account, gave us no pleasure. I
      hastened to reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was mighty nice of you men to think of it,” I said, cheerfully. “We do
      want to know the people in the country, and we are going to enjoy every
      moment. I was ‘surprised’ before the party began, that’s all.”
    </p>
    <p>Tex went out satisfied, grinning broadly.</p>
    <p>
      To my good fortune, Owen arrived before the guests came. I told him what
      was about to befall us. His expression was dubious. All he said was
      “Thunder.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen and one of the men had been driving about the country all the week,
      buying horses suitable to turn in on a Government cavalry contract. The
      night before they had spent on the floor of a cold railroad station,
      wrapped up in their blankets, with a lighted lantern under the covering at
      their feet. Their sleep was somewhat broken, with either cremation or
      freezing pending that cold September night. Poor Owen! He was completely
      worn out. And now he had to go through a surprise party.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o’clock, Tex, self-appointed master of ceremonies, ushered in the
      first arrivals. They were a tall, lean chap and two very much be-curled
      young misses. I made trials without number at conversation, but they could
      only be induced to say “Yes” and “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
      From eight until ten they came,—ranchmen, cow-punchers, ex-cow-punchers
      running their own outfits, infant cow-punchers, girls and women, until
      kitchen and sitting room were filled to overflowing, and every chair and
      bench on the place in use. Among the last to arrive was a tall, languid
      Texan, accompanied by two languid, drab-colored women. They were presented
      to us as “Robert, Missus Reed and Maggie.” “Maggie,” I immediately
      concluded, was a sister, but not being quite certain, I sought
      enlightenment from Mrs. Bohm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She ain’t Reed’s sister,” she informed me in a low tone, “she’s his
      girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, works for them, you mean?” I said, somewhat puzzled by the Reed
      connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Works nothin’,” Mrs. Bohm replied, scornfully. “She’s got the next place
      to ’em and goes with ’em everywhere. Ella don’t seem to mind. I’d just
      call her Maggie’ if I was you,” and Mrs. Bohm departed to join a group of
      women near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked over at the two with a new interest. They were chatting and
      laughing together, the “girl” and the wife seemingly on the best of terms,
      with no sign of rivalry for the tall Texan’s affections. Here was a
      situation fraught with latent possibilities that made me tremble,
      yet—“Ella don’t seem to mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen had been converted into a ballroom by moving the table up
      against the wall and placing three chairs upon it. Unfortunately the sink
      and stove were fixtures, but everything else, including the bread jar,
      found a temporary resting place in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bohm, with his fiddle under his arm, gingerly ascended the table
      first. Then another man followed with a similar instrument; and last came
      a youth with a mouth harp. No fatality having resulted from the musicians
      taking their seats, the dancing began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music, if such a combination of sounds can be dignified by that name,
      was such as to defy description. Never in the wildest flights of fancy
      could I have conceived of such execution and such sounds. The two men
      sawed their violins, and the third was purple in the face from his efforts
      on the mouth-harp; all were stamping time with their feet, and he of the
      harp was slapping his knee with his unoccupied hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before every dance a council was held, after which each musician would
      play the tune decided upon, as best suited to his taste. Old Bohm tried to
      get to the end in the shortest time possible, while the second fiddler,
      taking things more seriously, finished four or five bars behind his
      companion. The harpist, not playing “second” to anything or anybody, had
      his own opinion as to how “A Hot Time in the Old Town” should go. With
      these independent views, the result was a series of the most discordant
      sounds that ever fell on mortal ears. However, music mattered little, for
      all had come to have a good time, and the “caller-out,” with both eyes
      shut tight and arms folded across his breast, was making himself heard
      above all other sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Birdie in the center and all hands around!” he commanded. Then fiddles
      and mouth harp began a wild jig, couples raced ’round and ’round, while
      “Birdie,” a blond and blushing maiden, stood patiently in the midst of the
      whirling circle, until the next order came:
    </p>
    <div class="poetry-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="verse">“Birdie hop out and Crow hop in!</div>
          <div class="verse">Take holt of paddies and run around agin.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      “Crow” was a broad, heavy-set cow-puncher, wearing chaps, and in the
      endeavor to “run around agin,” I found my progress somewhat impeded by his
      spurs, which caught in my skirt and very nearly upset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the riders wore their heavy boots and spurs, and it required real
      agility to avoid being stepped on or having one’s skirt torn to ribbons. I
      was devoutly thankful that chiffon and tulle ball gowns were not worn on
      ranches.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more to avoid than spurs. We had to dance about the kitchen and
      avoid the stove, the sink and the tabled musicians, to say nothing of the
      nails in the floor. But after a few hours’ practice, I began to feel
      qualified to waltz on top of the House of the Seven Gables, and avoid at
      least six of them.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the caller-out shouted loudly:</p>
    <div class="poetry-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="verse">
            “Allemande, Joe! Right hand to pardner and around you go.
          </div>
          <div class="verse">Balance to corners, don’t be slack;</div>
          <div class="verse">Turn right around and take a back track.</div>
          <div class="verse">When you git home, don’t be afraid,</div>
          <div class="verse">Swing her agin and all promenade.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      My partner obeyed every command with such vigor that when at last he led
      me to my seat I was panting and dizzy; nor had I quite recovered my breath
      when the music struck up again, and Tex led me forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exertion of the first quadrille had been too much for his comfort, so
      he had dispensed with both collar and coat. His trousers and vest bore
      evidence of having seen many a round-up, and his shirt, which had once
      been white, was now multi-colored. In the wonderful red ascot tie which
      encircled his neck were stuck four scarf-pins, one above the other. There
      being nothing to hold the loop of the tie in place, it gradually worked up
      the back of his head, until its progress was stopped by the edge of a
      small skull-cap, which Tex wore as the crowning feature of his costume.
      The cap, tilted slightly to one side, gave him a rakish appearance, quite
      in contrast with his air of importance and responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I danced—my head fairly spins when I think <i>how</i> I danced—for, since
      the party was given in our honor, dance I must with every man who asked
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen, not being a dancing man, made himself agreeable to the wall-flowers
      and the children, stealing upstairs about once an hour for a few moments’
      nap on the bedroom floor. The beds themselves were occupied by sleeping
      infants, whose mothers were going through the intricate mazes of those
      dances below.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o’clock Tex began to make the coffee, whereupon the musicians
      descended from the table, and the expectant party sat down. But where were
      their baskets? My heart sank, as Tex approached holding a very small one.
      He informed me in a stage whisper it was all there was!
    </p>
    <p>
      The basket contained a cake and one wee chick, evidently fried soon after
      leaving the shell. It was the smallest chicken I ever saw. I hastily
      produced our cake and roast, and then took one despairing look around at
      the forty individuals to be fed. I shall never be able to explain it,
      unless Tex had an Aladdin’s lamp concealed in his pocket, for cake, roast
      and chicken appeared to be inexhaustible, and the supply more than equaled
      the demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was aroused from my contemplation of the miracle by a feminine voice,
      the speaker saying half to herself and half to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It took me most two hours to iron Nell’s dress this mornin’, but I sure
      got a pretty ‘do’ on it.” Following her beaming glance, I found that it
      rested on a mass of ruffles, which adorned the dress of “Birdie” of that
      first quadrille. Just then the music began again, and I saw Ed Lay ask her
      to dance. I trusted, after all that work, the ‘do’ wouldn’t be undone by
      his spurs; still the effort had not been wasted, for this was the fifth
      time he had danced with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doting mother could have taken more pride in the debut of an only
      child, than this work-worn sister whose eyes sparkled as they followed
      “Birdie’s” whirling figure held firmly by the encircling arm of the
      cow-puncher, and she murmured softly with a half sigh, “Ain’t it grand?”
      To me it was “grand” indeed, that even an embryo romance could bring a new
      light to those tired eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six o’clock Sunday morning when one most thoughtful person
      suggested that “they’d orter be goin’”; and by seven the last guest had
      departed. Then Owen and I, weary and heavy-eyed, donned our wraps, climbed
      into the wagon, and started on a sixteen-mile drive to the railroad to
      meet his brother, who was coming from California to see “how we were
      making it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was almost too tired to speak, but one thought was struggling for
      expression, and as we started up the first long hill, I had to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Anyone who ever spoke of the ‘peace and quiet of ranch life’ lived in New
      York and dreamed about it. In twenty-four hours I have discovered that we
      have an ex-convict for a trusted cook, and have received as guests a man
      with his wife and resident affinity. We have had a surprise party and I
      have danced with all the blemished characters the country boasts of, until
      six o’clock in the morning of the Sabbath day, with never a qualm of
      conscience. What do you suppose has become of my moral standards?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen was amused. He asked me, quizzically, what I thought they would be by
      the end of a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mercy!” I replied, “at the rate they are being overthrown, there won’t be
      enough left to consider, unless”—I thought a moment—“unless I can
      reconstruct a more enduring set from parts of the old.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch03">III—THE ROOT CELLAR</h2>
    <p>
      “East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.” The
      phrase kept haunting me all through these first days when everything was
      so new and strange. I almost felt as though I had passed into a new phase
      of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for Owen, there was no point of contact between the world of cities
      and people I had just left and this land of cattle and cow-punchers,
      bounded by the sky-rimmed hills. In Owen, however, the East and the West
      did meet. He understood and belonged to both and adapted himself as easily
      to the one as to the other. Wearing his derby, he belonged to the life of
      the East; in his broad-brimmed Stetson, he was a living part of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compelling reality of this new life affected me deeply. Non-essentials
      counted for nothing. There were no artificial problems or values.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one in the country cared who you might have been or who you were. The
      <i>Mayflower</i> and Plymouth Rock meant nothing here. It would be thought
      you were speaking of some garden flowers or some breed of chickens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing of vital importance was what you were—how you adjusted
      yourself to meet conditions as you found them, and how nearly you reached,
      or how far you fell below their measure of man or woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt as though up to this time I had been in life’s kindergarten, but
      that I had now entered into its school, and I realized that only as I
      passed the given tests should I succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned much from the rough, untutored men with whom I was in daily
      association. They were men whose rules of conduct were governed by
      individual choice, unhampered by conventions. They were so direct and
      honest, so unfailingly kind and gentle toward any weaker thing, and so
      simple and responsive, that I liked and trusted them from the first. All
      but old Bohm, the man from whom we were buying. He was such a totally
      different type that he seemed a man apart. The son of a German father and
      an Irish mother, he had inherited a nature too complex and contradictory
      to be easily fathomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bohm, with her white, calm face and gentle voice, attracted me, but
      her husband aroused in both Owen and me an instinctive distrust. He was
      good nature personified, a most companionable person, with his easy,
      contagious laugh, his amusing stories, quick wit, and breezy air of good
      fellowship. He could quote Burns, Scott, and other poets by the hour, and
      fiddle away on his violin, until we were nearly moved to tears. He was
      almost too good-natured; he didn’t quite ring true. I noticed that while
      he always referred or spoke to his wife affectionately, as “my old mammy,”
      her attitude toward him was rather impersonal. She called him “James” with
      quiet dignity, but seldom talked with him, and appeared to take very
      little interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the side of a hill, some distance from the house, was an old root
      cellar, used, according to Bohm, for storing potatoes, turnips, and other
      vegetables for winter. It was most inconveniently located; there were
      hillsides much nearer, and considering that the cellar under the house was
      always used for such purposes, it seemed strange that another should be
      needed so far away. I was possessed with a desire to explore it. It
      suggested hidden treasures and Indian relics, which I was collecting. One
      day I was poised on the top of the cellar step, about to descend into its
      mysterious depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bohm appeared. “Was you lookin’ for something’?” he asked, somewhat
      out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” I replied, going down a few steps. “I was just exploring, and
      thought I would investigate this old root cellar.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought that was what you was goin’ to do, and I hurried up to tell you
      to be awful careful of rattlesnakes; there’s a pile of ’em ’round these
      here old cellars.” Bohm spoke with apparent solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Heavens! I wouldn’t go down there for anything!” I exclaimed,—and I got
      out of the cellarway as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bohm looked down the steps at the strong, closed door of heavy boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, maybe it would be all right. You could listen for ’em and jump, if
      you heard ’em rattle,” he remarked, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. “Not much; I don’t want to hear them rattle,” and I
      started toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bohm went up toward the wind-mill. As I turned away I caught a curious
      expression on his face—a faint gleam of something.
    </p>
    <p>As I came through the meadow gate, Owen was getting into the buggy.</p>
    <p>
      “Hello,” he called, “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. I have to drive
      over to Three Bar. Do you want to go?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was always ready to go anywhere, so while Owen was driving the horses
      about, I ran in to get my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one of our horses was thoroughly broken, so we always had to follow
      the same method of procedure before starting anywhere. After the horses
      were hitched up, Charley, to whom fell odd jobs of every sort, stood at
      their heads until Owen was fairly seated and had the lines firmly in his
      hands. Then, after a few ineffectual attempts to kick or run down Charley
      before he could get out of the way, off dashed the horses around and
      around the open space between the house and the pond, until a little of
      the edge had been taken off their spirits. Then Owen stopped them for one
      moment, I made a quick jump into the buggy, and away we went at top speed
      toward the gate that Charley had run to open. We usually missed the post
      by a quarter of an inch, and at that juncture I invariably shut my eyes
      and held my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road to Three Bar Ranch led to the North and wound up a very long
      hill, then across a rolling mesa. The prairie was covered with short grama
      grass, just turning a faint brown, the yellow sunflowers and great clumps
      of rattleweed, with its spikes of lovely purple, giving a touch of color
      to the scene before us. The Spanish bayonet dotted the hillsides, and over
      all hung the summer sky like burnished copper. The only sound, aside from
      that of the horses’ hoofs and the crunch of the wheels on the soft prairie
      road, was the occasional song of the meadow lark, all the joy of the
      summer day sounding in its one short thrilling note. In the gulches, where
      the grass grew deep and rank, the wind tossed it softly, and it rippled
      and sparkled in the shifting light, as water gleams in the sun. Everything
      was so still that animation seemed for the time suspended, as we drove
      along silenced by the spell of the prairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three Bar, one of the oldest ranches in the country, stood against the
      side of a hill. It was a long, low structure of logs built in the
      prevailing fashion of the early ranch houses, room after room opening into
      one another, usually with an outside door to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ranch was owned by the Mortons, English people, who were among the
      earliest settlers in the country. They greeted us most cordially, and as
      Owen went out to the corral with Mr. Morton to look at some horses, Mrs.
      Morton took me into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room we entered had very little furniture, but was redeemed from
      bareness by a wonderful old stone fireplace at one end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was short and heavy set. “Spotless” was the only word her
      appearance suggested when I first saw her. Her skin was as fair as a
      child’s, while her hair was as white as the apron she wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her flow of conversation was unceasing, and I was reminded of a remark
      that Charley made to me when the telephone was first put in over the fence
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old lady Morton talked so fast that she ripped all the barbs off the
      wire.” Before I had time to reply to one question, she had asked another,
      and was off on an entirely different subject. I suppose the accumulated
      conversation of months was vented on my innocent head, for she told me,
      poor thing, that she hadn’t seen another woman since Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Us”—she never said we—“us never visits the neighbors, but was coming up
      to see you, Mrs. Brook, for us heard you and Mr. Brook was different. Us
      lives out here on a ranch, but us knows when people are the right kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t know whether to be considered “different” was desirable, or not,
      and I was dying to ask her what constituted “the right kind,” but had no
      time before she suddenly asked:
    </p>
    <p>“Have the Bohms gone? Us was waiting till they went.”</p>
    <p>
      I explained that they were still on the ranch, as Mr. Bohm had to gather
      and counterbrand all the stock before turning it over to Owen, and that he
      had been delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton gave a little grunt of contempt. “Old Bohm won’t hurry any
      while he’s getting free board. He may be with you all winter. Us hopes Mr.
      Brook won’t be imposed on. He’s a smart man, old Jim Bohm is, but he’s a
      bad one.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bad one?” I repeated, inwardly praying that the Bohms would not be
      permanent guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Jim Bohm is a bad man,” Mrs. Morton said again, rocking violently
      back and forth. “I was here when they came. She’s all right, but there is
      nothing he won’t do. Why”—her voice sank to a whisper—“sixteen men have
      been traced as far as that ranch and never been heard of again, and Jim
      Bohm’s been getting richer all along.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton scarcely paused for breath, so I couldn’t have said anything.
      But I was speechless, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not one of them, not one,” she declared, “was ever heard of again, and if
      you were to examine that old root cellar on the hill, you’d find out what
      I say is true.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident of the morning flashed across my mind, and I felt as though a
      piece of ice were being drawn slowly along my spine.
    </p>
    <p>“How perfectly horrible!” I managed to gasp, “but it can’t be true.”</p>
    <div class="image-center">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      “It’s true, all right.” There was no doubting Mrs. Morton’s conviction.
      “There’s facts there’s no getting ’round. Jim Bohm and old Happy Dick,
      that used to work for him, came up here over the trail from Texas with a
      band of horses that Bohm and another man owned. The other fellow was with
      them when they started, but Bohm said he died on the way, and that’s all
      anyone knows about it, except that old Bohm kept all the horses.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then a few years later, a young fellow that was consumptive, came out to
      work for them. I know he had quite a bit of money, because he stopped here
      once to ask John what to do with it. He hadn’t been there very long before
      he dropped dead, according to Jim Bohm’s story. His folks back East tried
      to get the money, but Bohm said the fellow owed it to him, and they
      couldn’t do a thing about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat as if petrified, unable to take my eyes from Mrs. Morton’s face, as
      she went on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was in with all the rustlers in the country,” she continued, “and once
      when a posse was hunting a man who had stole a lot of horses, Bohm tried
      his best to keep them from searching the place, but the Sheriff told him
      they would arrest him if he made any more fuss about it, so he had to keep
      still. When they came to the haymow, they stuck a pitchfork right into a
      man hidden in the hay, and old Bohm swore he didn’t know a thing about his
      being there. The next us heard, old Bill Law had dropped dead in the
      corral. I tell you”—Mrs. Morton leaned forward and shook her finger in my
      face—“it’s mighty funny, the way men keeps dropping dead over there; they
      don’t do it anywhere else. Happy Dick was the last. About a year ago he
      told Morton he’d stole two men rich, and now he was going to steal himself
      rich. But two days after he was found dead in the willows, and Bohm said
      that when he came upon the body, Happy Dick had been dead for hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton showed signs of running down for a moment, so I hastened to
      ask why it was that, though suspicion always pointed toward him, old Bohm
      had never been arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jim Bohm’s too smooth,” Mrs. Morton answered. “If you found him with a
      smoking gun in his hand and a man dead on the ground beside him, he’d lie
      out of it somehow; probably would swear that as he came up, he saw the man
      shoot himself. Oh! he’s a slick one. Us always said us pitied anyone who
      had business dealings with him, but,” she stopped as she saw Owen and Mr.
      Morton coming up the walk, “Mr. Brook looks like a man that can take care
      of himself. I’d watch out for Bohm, though. Watch out for him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thank you, Mrs. Morton,” I said, as Owen came to the door. “I am glad you
      told me. Please come to see us,” and with conflicting emotions I prepared
      to leave Three Bar Ranch.
    </p>
    <p>I scarcely knew what to think. I was worried, and yet——</p>
    <p>
      When I told Owen I expected him to pooh-pooh the story and relieve my
      mind, but he did nothing of the sort. With a queer little wrinkle between
      his eyes, he listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Owen, you don’t think there is any truth in it, do you?” I asked, much
      troubled by his silence. He flicked a fly off Dan’s back before replying:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know what to think. The old chap’s a rascal, there’s no doubt
      about that; but I didn’t suppose he was a cold-blooded murderer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I felt the ice go up and down my spine. “Great heavens, Owen, can’t
      you have someone go through the root cellar, to see if there is anything
      out of the way there? And, above all, get the stock gathered and ship
      Bohm—I despise him, anyhow!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t let it worry you,” said Owen; “probably it’s all mere talk. Bohm
      won’t bother us; and in a few weeks the stock will all be turned over and
      he’ll have no excuse for staying.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A few weeks is a long time,” I said, gloomily, feeling as if my hold on
      life were gradually slipping. “According to Mrs. Morton, everybody on the
      place might drop dead in less time than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen laughed, but the next moment a shadow crossed his face, and he said
      decisively:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m going to look into that root-cellar business. I want to have the
      place thoroughly cleaned out, anyhow.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      The boys were going in to supper when we drove up. Charley came to take
      the horses, and Owen greeted him:
    </p>
    <p>“Well, how’s everything?”</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, all right,” answered Charley indifferently, as he started to loosen
      the tugs. “Nothin’s happened since you folks went away, only the old root
      cellar’s caved in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Speech was impossible. Owen and I stood as if petrified, looking at each
      other. We turned to go up to the house. I felt as though some wretched
      fate were making game of us. As we entered the door, Owen spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Esther”—he was very serious—“don’t say a word or betray any interest
      whatever in this matter. After supper is over, I’ll go up to investigate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk about the skeleton at a feast! There were sixteen horrid, grinning
      things around the table that night, besides a few that Mrs. Morton had
      overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bohm was whiter than usual and very quiet. Old Bohm was in high
      spirits. We were scarcely seated before he declared it “a damn shame” that
      the old root cellar had to cave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We showed a little surprise, but affected unconcern. Playing the role
      assigned to me, I remarked indifferently that we never used it, anyhow,
      and with this Bohm cheerfully agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when Owen went up to examine the cellar, I noticed, from my point
      of observation at the window, that old Bohm was close by his side.
    </p>
    <p>Soon after Owen came in looking very grave.</p>
    <p>
      “Well, it caved in, all right, and it never can be cleaned out. But
      there’s one thing I am convinced of”—and he looked toward the hill with a
      frown—“it didn’t cave in of itself.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch04">IV—THE GREAT ADVENTURE PROGRESSES</h2>
    <p>
      John, the mail carrier, was our only connecting link with the great
      outside world. Three times a week he brought the mail. From the first
      sight of a tiny speck on the top of the distant hill, our hearts thrilled.
      I watched it grow larger and larger, until the two-wheeled cart stopped at
      the garden gate. With hands trembling with impatience, I unlocked the old,
      worn bag, which John threw on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was the honorable Postmistress. My desk was covered with Postal Laws,
      which I almost learned by heart. I had the New England respect for the
      Federal prison, the place of correction for delinquent Postal employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      One rule was absolute. The key of the mail bag had to be securely attached
      to the Post Office. My Post Office was a wooden cracker box, which held
      the mail for the few outside patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector of Post Offices arrived unannounced one day. He frowningly
      looked over my accounts, while I stood by in perturbation. Suddenly he
      caught sight of the key at the end of a long brass chain “securely
      attached to the Post Office.” He got up to investigate. The frown
      disappeared by magic, and a smile played around his stern mouth. He burst
      into laughter. I explained I was very careful to comply with all the
      regulations. He gave me a humorous glance—and stayed to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers on Monday evening brought us exciting news. A train on the U.
      P. had been held up at a lonely station, thirty miles from our ranch. All
      the Pullman passengers had been robbed and one man shot and killed. The
      hold-ups had escaped and were at large in the “country adjoining.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If they are in the country adjoining, they’ll come here eventually,” I
      remarked to Owen. “This ranch is a perfect magnet for all the questionable
      characters in the vicinity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen thanked me for the compliment and went out to the bunk house to
      interview Robert Reed, now in charge of the hay gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Reed was an interesting fellow,—a natural leader of men, and so
      efficient that Owen had made him hay foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had driven over to his claim to see him about working for us, Mrs.
      Reed came out to the buggy, wiping her hands on her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, Bob ain’t home this morning,” she responded to Owen’s inquiry for her
      husband. “I reckon you’ll find him over ploughin’ for Maggie.” A statement
      made in the most matter-of-fact manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove over to another claim shack a mile or so from the Reeds’, where
      Bob was indeed ploughing for Maggie. To him, too, it was quite a matter of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affinity problem in this country really appeared simple. Mrs. Reed
      evidently accepted Maggie as a natural factor in the situation, and her
      marital relations were not disturbed in the least, as long as Bob finished
      his own ploughing first. That woman was truly oriental in her cast of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggie Lane’s mother and brother lived near at hand, also. One brother,
      Tom, was Reed’s constant companion. Altogether it was a perfectly
      harmonious arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lane family records were not quite clear. Acquaintance revealed that.
      They all seemed to have a penchant for leaving the straight and narrow
      path for the broad highway of individual choice. Obviously Maggie’s
      position did not affect her family, nor her social standing in the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I drove about the country without Owen, I took Charley with me on
      horseback. Gates were hard to open, and my team of horses was not
      thoroughly broken. Besides, there were always the possibilities of the
      unexpected on these lonely prairies. I called Charley my Knight of the
      Garter. When he knew in advance he was going with me, he went up to the
      bunkhouse “to slick up.” If it chanced to be summer, he emerged without a
      coat, his blue shirt sleeves held up by a pair of beribboned pink garters,
      a pair of heavy stamped leather cuffs on his wrists, and a heavy stamped
      leather collar holding his neck like a vise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested one morning that the collar might be uncomfortably warm. He
      met my objection with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hot, Mrs. Brook? Why, that ain’t hot. You see, the leather kinda ab-sorbs
      the sweat and makes it nice and cool.”
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we were out to take the washing to Mrs. Reed. I had asked Bob to
      take it Saturday night, when he and Tom Lane had “gone over home” to
      finish that ploughing. I supposed he had done so, but when he came back on
      Monday, he said he had “plumb forgot it, but would take it next time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to pass through Maggie’s claim on the way. She was standing at her
      door, as we stopped to open the gate. There was no freshly ploughed ground
      in sight, and I idly asked if she had finished her ploughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” she replied, “I kinda looked for Bob over Sunday to finish it, but I
      reckon he couldn’t get off. I wish you’d tell him to stop here the next
      time he goes home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove on, and I wondered what Maggie “reckoned” he couldn’t get away
      from,—the ranch or his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave Mrs. Reed the clothes and I told her Bob had forgotten to bring
      them over with him Saturday. She looked at me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>“Didn’t Bob work Sunday?”</p>
    <p>
      “No,” I replied, “none of the men worked Sunday. Tom and Bob both said
      they were going home.”
    </p>
    <p>Mrs. Reed frowned.</p>
    <p>“Oh, I suppose Maggie had somethin’ she wanted him to do.”</p>
    <p>Charley started to answer, but my look stopped him.</p>
    <p>
      “I’ll have your clothes ready Saturday.” Mrs. Reed slammed the gate and
      turned toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gee,” said Charley, riding up close beside the buggy, “them two women’ll
      be fightin’ over Bob yet, if he ain’t careful. Why, that’s funny”—he
      looked at me questioningly,—“Bob wasn’t to Maggie’s, either, was he?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” I answered, “I was just wondering about that myself. Perhaps he went
      to town, instead.” A coyote ran out of a gulch. Charley with a whoop
      started in pursuit, and the entire incident passed from my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were going in to supper, when three men drove up to the door. Whenever
      strangers appeared, I always had a moment of uncertainty as to whether
      they were to be sent to the bunkhouse with the men, or invited to our own
      table. Instantaneous social classification is rather difficult when there
      are no distinguishing external signs. And it had to be done at the moment.
      The men asked for Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no idea who they were, so our conversation during supper was
      limited to impersonal topics, such as the present, past and future
      weather, the condition of the range and stock—nothing calculated to offend
      the delicate sensibilities of a Governor, a ranchman or an ex-convict,
      inasmuch as our guests might come under any of these heads. Entertaining
      on a ranch is democratic in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out with Owen after supper. From the window I could see four dim
      figures sitting on their heels by the corral gate, talking earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when they drove away. I was putting up the mail, as Owen
      entered. His announcement drove all idea of the Postal Laws and
      regulations out of my head.
    </p>
    <p>“Well, they’ve gone, and have taken Bob and Tom Lane with them.”</p>
    <p>“Mercy! what for? Who were they, anyhow?”</p>
    <p>
      “The Sheriff and two Pinkerton men,” he answered, gravely. “They have
      arrested Bob and Tom for the hold-up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Owen,” I gasped, standing up so suddenly that the U. S. mail flew in all
      directions. “You don’t believe they were the ones, do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not for a minute,” Owen answered, with conviction. “And I told them so,
      but it seems the men have bad records and the description fits them. ‘A
      tall man, with a Southern accent, and a short, slight, smaller man.’ So
      they arrested them.” Owen sat down. “It’s absurd. In the first place, they
      couldn’t have gotten to the railroad in time to hold up the limited. They
      didn’t leave here until nine o’clock, and in the next place, they went
      home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they didn’t.” I felt suddenly weak in my knees. “I took the clothes
      over to Mrs. Reed, and both she and Maggie were wondering why they hadn’t
      come.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen looked at me in blank amazement, and then asked why on earth I hadn’t
      told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good heavens, Owen, I haven’t seen you a moment alone. And, besides, I
      never supposed it made any difference <i>where</i> the men went. Hereafter
      if the angel Gabriel comes to work for us, I shall insist upon knowing
      where he spends his nights. Really,” I began to laugh, “you know, if we
      ever leave this ranch, the only place we shall feel at home is in the
      penitentiary. None but people with ‘records’ and ‘pasts’ will interest
      us.” I was half amused and wholly excited, for even to have a speaking
      acquaintance with the leading figures in a hold-up and murder was
      something my wildest flight of imagination could have scarcely pictured a
      few months before. Owen was really serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I must say,” he shook his head and looked down at the floor, “it
      begins to look as though Bob and Tom might have some trouble proving they
      weren’t the men. It’s serious for them, since they weren’t at home. The
      description certainly fits them.” Owen took up the paper. “‘One man about
      five feet eight inches high, slender and light mustache, wearing old
      clothes and a rusty black slouch hat. The other man five feet ten inches
      tall, slender, short, black mustache, about forty years old, spoke with a
      Southern accent, wore an old black suit and an old striped rubber coat.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go on,” I said, as Owen started to put the paper down; “I want to hear
      it.” He read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The men were supposed to have boarded the train coming from Denver, at a
      small station this side of Star. The Pullmans were on the rear. When the
      train stopped at the station, the Pullman conductor went out on the back
      platform and saw two men crouching in the vestibule. He told them to get
      off, but at that moment the train started, and they rose up, covering him
      with their revolvers. One got behind him, holding his gun against him, the
      other in front. They handed him a gunny-sack and made him carry it. In
      this manner they entered the body of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘In the first car they got very little plunder, and pushed on into the
      next. As they entered the second sleeper, they met the porter, who was
      forced to elevate his hands and precede them. While they were engaged in
      robbing the passengers in the second Pullman, the train conductor entered,
      and was compelled to elevate his hands, with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘They paused at one berth and seemed very much incensed that the woman it
      contained was so slow in handing over her valuables. They swore and were
      very impatient. Suddenly, a man in the next berth thrust his head out
      between the curtains. He had a revolver in his hand and fired, but
      instantly another shot rang out from the robber in the rear, and the man
      sank back in his berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘After the shooting, the robbers appeared more nervous and hurried. When
      they had gone through the car, they took the gunny-sack and emptied the
      contents into their pockets. One of the robbers pulled the bell-rope, but
      evidently not hard enough, for the train continued on its way. Swearing,
      they compelled the porter and two conductors to stand out on the platform
      with them, covered by their revolvers, until the train slowed down at
      Paxton, when they swung off to the ground and disappeared into these vast
      prairie lands, which are so sparsely settled one can drive for a day
      without seeing a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘As soon as the train stopped, the passengers hurried to the berth of the
      man who had been shot, but he had been instantly killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘The Sheriff was notified, and a posse started in pursuit, but the
      robbers had vanished.’” Owen put down the paper, and we sat up far into
      the night talking it over.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      Subsequently our ranch, our horses, and Owen’s opinions were freely quoted
      in the press. Bob and Tom were positively identified by the three trainmen
      as the hold-ups. They were retained a week in jail, and then suddenly
      released on “insufficient proof.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen did not believe in point of time they could have held up the train,
      for he had talked to Bob that Saturday night until after nine o’clock, but
      everybody, including Owen, held them capable of it. The point was simply
      that they had not happened to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Bob and Tom returned to the ranch, incensed at their arrest and
      detention, but no one ever learned where they were that memorable Saturday
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the men who held up the train were never found, and again one of
      those strange tragedies of the West ended in vagueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was struck by the repetition of that phenomenon “A crime, a tragedy.” At
      first indignation and an earnest attempt to find the offenders and bring
      them to justice, then delay, and the whole affair shoved into the
      background by something newer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life here seemed to flow by like a stream at flood-tide. Who could stem
      that current long enough to catch those bits of human frailty floating on
      the surface, or follow them down stream to the sea?
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch05">V—A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT</h2>
    <p>
      From the first, I had been conscious of a fascination about the West
      impossible to describe. Its charm was too enigmatical and elusive for
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a suggestion of the sea in that vast circle and in the long
      undulations of the prairie, as though great waves had become solidified,
      then clothed in softest green. No sign of restless movement was apparent
      in those billows which stretched away from the mountains into the vague
      distance. All was still. The towering mountain itself was the symbol of
      infinite peace and rest. Yet there, in the midst of that unbroken
      serenity, stood a cluster of buildings, the center of the greatest
      activity, where life was vital and thrilling as though a few human beings
      had been flung through space and dropped onto those silent plains to work
      out the age-long fight for existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace and conflict, silence and sound, absence of life and life in its
      most complex form; contrasts—everywhere and in everything—it could be
      defined, it was in “contrasts” that the fascination of the West was
      expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranch life might be difficult; it was never commonplace. The mere sight of
      a lone horseman on a distant hill suggested greater possibilities of
      excitement than a multitude of people in a city street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each day brought so many new experiences, some of comedy, some of tragedy,
      that I began to look for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Government had awarded a contract to furnish “150 horses of a
      dark bay color for cavalry use” our life became dramatic, with the riders
      cast in the leading roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage-setting consisted of a large circular corral, twelve feet high,
      built of heavy pitch-pine posts and three-inch planks with a massive
      snubbing post set in the center. Since there was “standing room only,”
      cracks were at a premium.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The dramatis personae</i> were two tall, slender-waisted cow-punchers
      who walked with a slightly rolling gait, due to extremely high-heeled
      boots, much too small for them. In their right hands they carried a coiled
      rope swinging easily. Their costumes were composed of cloth or corduroy
      trousers, dark-colored shirts, nondescript vests of some sort, dark blue
      or red handkerchiefs knotted loosely about their necks, expensively-made
      boots, the tops of which were covered by the legs of their “pants”; spurs,
      of course; high-priced Stetson hats, the crowns creased to a peak, and
      frequently encircled by the skin of a rattle-snake, and exceedingly soft
      gauntlet-gloves. It was my observation that the old-time cow-puncher wore
      gloves at all times. He did remove them when eating, and, I presume,
      before going to bed, but they were always in evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “Star” is a frightened, snorting “broncho,” or unbroken horse which
      for the five or six years of its life had been running loose. Now it was
      to be “busted.” It is cut out from the bunch and run into the corral and
      the gate securely fastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men stands near the post, the other does the roping. Facing the
      men, the broncho stands still, his head high, his eyes wild and full of
      fear. An abrupt motion by one of the riders starts him on a frantic run
      around and around in a circle. A sudden throw of the rope and both front
      feet are in the loop. Quick as lightning the man settles back on it, both
      front legs are pulled out from under the horse and he falls on his side;
      the helper runs to his head, seizes the muzzle and twists it straight up,
      thrusts one knee against the neck and holds the top of the head to the
      ground. The roper puts two or three more loops above the front hoofs,
      passes the rope, now doubled forming a loop, between the legs, to one of
      the hind feet, then pulls on the end that he has all the time held. This
      action draws all three feet together. One or two more loops about them, a
      hitch and the horse is tied so that it is impossible for him to get up.
      While the broncho lies helpless, the saddle and bridle are put on, a large
      handkerchief passed under the straps of the bridle over the eyes and made
      fast. The rope is taken off. Feeling a measure of freedom, he staggers to
      his feet and stands. The cinches are drawn very tight, the rider mounts,
      gives a sharp order to “let him go,” the man on the ground pulls the
      handkerchief from the eyes of the horse, and jumps aside.
    </p>

        <p>INSPECTING A BRAND</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      For a moment the broncho stands dazed, then jumps, throws his head between
      his front legs almost to the ground, squeals, humps his back and pitches
      around and around the corral in a vain attempt to rid himself of the
      fearsome thing on his back. The circular corral, limited in space, gives
      little opportunity to succeed; the rider has the advantage. The horse
      stops pitching and runs frantically about the corral, at length tiring
      himself out. Dripping with sweat, trembling from fear and excitement, he
      comes to a slow trot. The gate is thrown open. Making a dash for freedom,
      he plunges through the outside corrals, the horseman or “circler” close
      beside him, trying to keep between the half-crazed broncho and any object
      he might run into. The horse bolts out into the open; his is the advantage
      now, and he makes the rider ride. He bucks this way and that, twisting,
      turning, jumping and running, the man on his back so racked and shaken it
      seems incredible that his body can hold together. They tear out over the
      prairie in a wild race, far off over the hills, out of sight now. After a
      time they come back on a walk. The broncho has been busted—the act has
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the horse rear and throw himself backward, there is the greatest
      danger that the man may be caught under him and killed, it happens so
      quickly, but these quiet, diffident chaps are absolutely fearless, past
      masters in the art of riding, facing death each time they ride a new
      horse, but facing it with the supreme courage of the commonplace, sitting
      calmly in the saddle, racked, shaken, jolted until at times the blood
      streams from their nose, yet after a short rest the rider “took up the
      next one” quite as though nothing at all had happened. All the horses had
      to be broken and then made ready for the inspection of the Government
      officials, and the boys were working with them early and late.

      It was an unusual experience to live in daily association with these men,
      in whom were combined characteristics of the Knights of the Round Table
      and those peculiar to the followers of Jesse James.

      In Douglas, Wyoming, there stands a monument erected by the friends of a
      local character who, curiously, bore the same surname as the famous
      explorer for whom Pike’s Peak was named. Chiseled out of the solid granite
      these opposing traits are epitomized in this unique epitaph:

      Strange, contrasting personalities—in awe of nobody, quite as ready to

      preferring Owen because they knew he was a fine horseman.

      Persons and things outside their own world held but slight interest for
      them. At first I had a hazy idea that I might be the medium through which
      a glimpse of the outside world would broaden the narrow limits of their
      lives. I planned to get books for them and to arrange a reading room, but
      my dream was soon shattered upon discovering that this broader view
      possessed no charm. Indeed, when I offered to teach Joe to read he refused
      my offer without a moment’s hesitation, firmly announcing “I ain’t goin’
      to learn to read, ’cause then I’d have to!” “Why, Mrs. Brook,” he added,
      looking with scorn at the book I held in my hand, “I wouldn’t be bothered
      the way you are for nothin’, havin’ to read all them books in there,”
      nodding his head in the direction of our cherished library. This was
      certainly a fresh point of view regarding education. About the same time I
      found that the Sears and Roebuck or Montgomery Ward catalogue might be
      fittingly called the Bible of the plains. Night after night the boys pored
      over them absorbed in the illustrations, of hats, gloves, boots and
      saddles, the things most dear to their hearts, for on their riding
      equipment alone they spent a small fortune.

      The religion of the cow-puncher? My impression was that he had none, for
      certainly he subscribed to no conventional creed or dogma. Yet what was it
      that gave him a code of honor which made cheating or a lie an unforgivable
      offense and a man guilty of either an outcast scorned by his associates,
      and what was it that would have made him go without bread or shelter that
      a woman or child might not suffer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Rough and gentle, brutal and tender, good and bad, not angel at one time
      and devil at another, but rather saint and sinner at the same time. Little
      of religious influence came into his life, and as for Bibles—there were
      none.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember the story of a Bishop who was travelling through the West and
      was asked to hold service in one of the larger towns. When he arrived he
      found that he had left his own Bible on the train, so he sent the hotel
      clerk out to borrow one. After some time the man returned with a Bible,
      explaining to the Bishop that it was the only one in town. “I went
      everywhere and finally got this one. It’s the one they use at the Court
      House to swear on!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow-puncher, however, could swear without any assistance, for usually
      “cussin’” formed a very necessary part of his conversation. But as I sat
      at my window sewing one summer morning I heard a violent argument at the
      corral between Fred and a new “hay-hand” from Kansas. Fred’s voice was
      decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s all right, but you cut out that cussin’ here—the Missus’ window’s
      open, and she’ll hear you.” And the heart of “the Missus” warmed to her
      Knight of the Corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another incident, the true significance of which I did not know
      until three years after it occurred, when the foreman of the L—— ranch met
      Owen in Denver and inquired for me, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I’ll never forget Mrs. Brook. Do you remember the day we was
      shippin’ them white faces from the Junction about three years ago, when
      you and Mrs. Brook happened to come along and stopped to watch us? Well,
      one of the best men I had was brandin’ a calf when it kicked him and he
      swore at it proper; all of a sudden he looked up and saw Mrs. Brook and
      another lady standin’ on that high platform by the yards watchin’ us. He
      was so plumb beat, he threw down his brandin’ iron, took up his hat,
      walked across the street to a saloon and began drinkin’ and stayed drunk
      for three days, and there I was, short-handed, with a train-load of cows
      and calves to ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrast again—chivalry carried to the extent of being drunk for three
      days because he had sworn before a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were all being ridden and trained for the inspection which was
      soon to take place. Each man had his own “string,” those he had broken,
      and every day they were put through their paces. When inspected, they had
      to be walked, trotted and run up and down before the officers, stopped
      instantly, and the veterinarian was supposed to put his ear to their
      chests to see if their breathing was regular and their hearts sound. Now,
      Western horses are not accustomed to having their hearts tested, and I
      noticed that while the riders did everything else that was required, they
      tacitly agreed “to let the vet do his own listnin’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that the Army officers were to arrive, as Owen was getting ready
      to drive over to the station to meet them, I remarked casually that I
      hoped nothing would happen to upset their peace of mind, as it was very
      important that the honorable representatives of the Government be kept in
      a good humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was still in an unsettled condition but for the time being it
      had been brought into sufficient order to insure their comfort. The larder
      was stocked with the best the markets afforded and the horses were being
      “gentled” daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      When guests came on the train our dinner might be served at any hour up to
      ten o’clock at night for after their arrival at the station there was the
      sixteen mile drive to the ranch—and anything might happen. It was late
      that particular night when I heard them at the meadow gate. I couldn’t
      understand why they stopped so long. There were sounds of confusion and as
      they entered the house one of the officers held up a finger dripping with
      blood, the Colonel’s hat was awry, his clothes covered with mud, and they
      all appeared agitated and excited. I could not imagine what had happened.
      Then they all began to tell me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon reaching the meadow gate the Lieutenant who acted as bookkeeper
      jumped out to open it but failed to return after they had driven through.
      Upon investigation they found he had caught his finger between the wire
      loop and the post and was held fast. They extricated him from his dilemma
      and drove on. It was very dark and upon reaching the house as the august
      Colonel descended from the wagon, he tripped over a pile of stones lying
      near the gate, fell down and just escaped breaking his neck. I tried to
      smile and yet be sympathetic—but I had a vision of Owen with “one hundred
      fifty horses of a dark bay color” on his hands if the good humor of the
      officers was not restored before morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were shown to their rooms and I prayed nothing would happen to the
      Veterinarian, who had so far remained intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel and the Lieutenant had come down stairs. We were all in the
      library waiting for the Doctor before going in to dinner, when we heard a
      fearful crash. We rushed into the hall to see the poor man sitting on the
      steps holding both hands to his head. He was very tall and, coming down
      the narrow winding stairs, had struck his head on an overhanging
      projection which he had failed to observe. His injury was more
      uncomfortable than serious and had quite a cheering effect on his two
      companions, who began to chaff him about “taking off an inch or two” so by
      the time dinner was over they were all in high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning at nine the inspection began. Each horse was brought
      out, looked over and measured to see that he came up to the stipulated
      number of “hands”. If he passed he was immediately ridden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the men rode the horses he had broken. First the horse was walked
      up and down between the blacksmith-shop and the corral, then trotted and
      then run, after which his lungs and breathing were tested and if
      satisfactory he was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time a man got on to ride, I was conscious of a feeling of great
      uncertainty. The horses looked quiet enough and were fairly gentle, but
      Owen and I knew that the slightest variation in the manner of mounting or
      “touching them up” might cause them to go through a few movements not
      required by the United States Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, all those we had expected to buck behaved like lambs, while
      those which had been considered fairly well broken did everything from
      bucking to snorting and blowing foam all over the Veterinarian when he
      attempted to examine their teeth and test their lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three days the inspection went on, each day more interesting than the
      last, until all the horses had been examined and out of the number the
      necessary one hundred and fifty accepted and branded U. S.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the bunch of horses headed for Denver was being driven off the ranch,
      Fred looked after them reflectively—
    </p>
    <p>
      “If them sodjers can ride, it’ll be all right,” he remarked, “but if they
      go to puttin’ tenderfeet on them bronchs, they’ll land in Kingdom-come
      before they ever hit the saddle.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch06">VI—A VARIETY OF RUNAWAYS</h2>
    <p>
      Life in any primitive, sparsely settled country is fraught with adventure.
      It is the element which gives zest to everyday affairs and which lifts
      existence above the commonplace, but since everything has its price, the
      price of untrammelled living must often be paid in discomfort and
      inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To us, and to many others, abounding health and freedom were ample
      compensations for a few annoying circumstances but with our guests it was
      a more serious consideration. After a few experiences we began to
      discourage the visits of those unfitted by nature and temperament for
      “roughing it”.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not control the elements nor untoward events. Fate had such an
      invariable custom of upsetting and rearranging all of our most carefully
      laid plans that when friends, especially “tenderfeet”, arrived, we had a
      premonition that before they departed something would happen. It never
      failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house our guests were exempt from anxiety and discomfort, but no
      one cared to stay indoors when a dazzling world of blue, green and gold
      lay just outside, and the unexpected was no regarder of persons. A
      cloud-burst was just as apt to descend upon the unsuspecting head of a
      delicate, carefully nurtured old lady as was an indiscriminating
      rattlesnake to frighten some timid soul into hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone who came to the ranch wanted to ride, those knowing least about
      horses being the most insistent, and not wishing to take any chances, at
      first we gave them Billy, gentle, trustworthy Billy, who, when running
      loose, could be caught by a man on foot and ridden into the corral with a
      handkerchief around his neck instead of a bridle. We would start out, the
      tenderfoot joyously “off for a horseback ride,” and the next thing we knew
      he would be off the horse doubled up under a fence or lying flat on the
      prairie, while Billy peacefully nibbled grass. No one could explain it
      unless the uninitiated had lost a stirrup and had unwittingly given the
      horse a dig in the ribs which was immediately resented—so even Billy was
      disqualified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, none of our horses was sufficiently well broken for the
      inexperienced horseman to ride or drive. They behaved very decently until
      something occurred, which was out of the ordinary, and then the reaction
      was most sudden and disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the stock on the ranch we had acquired about four hundred horses,
      most of which had never been handled and were running loose on the range.
      Before they were of any use or value they had to be broken and Owen felt
      that it was one of the most important things to be done. Consequently,
      many of the horses were broken to drive in the hay field, the broncho
      hitched up with a gentle horse, and put onto the rake or mowing
      machine—many were the runaways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was leisurely by nature. He never hurried either in speech or
      movement. Owen and I were in the office one morning when he strolled
      around the house and up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mis-ter Brook,” he drawled, “Ja-ne and Maud are running away with the
      mow-ing machine down in the timber—they throw-ed Windy off the seat,” but
      before he got the last word out, his listener was down the steps, over the
      fence and on his way toward the creek where Maud and Jane were tearing
      through the timber leaving parts of the mowing machine on stumps and
      fallen logs, while Charley looked after him in mild surprise. The horses
      were brought to an abrupt stop when one tried to go on one side of a tree
      and the other on the opposite side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a beautiful black horse, “Toledo”, that refused to allow anyone
      to come near him but Owen or Bill, and there was also a new man on the
      ranch who so constantly boasted of his ability to handle bronchos the boys
      had dubbed him “Windy”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windy concluded one day that he would harness Toledo alone. There were
      violent sounds in the stable, snorts, shouts, thumps, and Windy sailed
      through the open door and landed on a conveniently placed pile of manure,
      frightened to death but unhurt.
    </p>
    <p>Bill was furious.</p>
    <p>
      “What’d you do to him, anyhow?” he stormed after roping Toledo who had
      broken his halter and was running loose in the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t do nothin’ to him,” protested Windy. “I just crope up and
      retched over and tetched him and he begun to snort and cave ’round.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Course you didn’t do nothin’, you couldn’t do nothin’ if you tried. You’d
      better go back to town where you belong, ’stead a stayin’ out here
      spoilin’ good horses.” Bill’s choler was rising. “You don’t know nothin’
      neither, you’re jest a bone head, your spine’s jest growed up and haired
      over.” And, leading the subdued Toledo, Bill disappeared into the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the team that Owen reserved for his own use had passed the kicking
      and lunging stage and I had become sufficiently confident to look at the
      landscape instead of watching their ears, he usually concluded they were
      “pretty well broken” and that he must try out a new one. This trying out
      process went on indefinitely, for Owen’s New England conscience gave him
      no peace apparently while an unbroken horse remained in his possession. It
      was a form of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had guests we used, what my husband was pleased to call, a gentle
      team, one that started off decorously with all their feet on the ground
      instead of in the air, but one day when we were expecting some friends
      from Wyoming he could not resist driving a new pair of beautiful bay
      horses when we went to meet them. I remained behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner hour passed and no Owen; additional hours went by and late at
      night he came in dusty, dirty and scratched.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a perfect volley of questions he explained that he was all
      right, but the Lawtons had telegraphed they had been detained, and then he
      added, as quite an unimportant detail, that “the horses had run away.” He
      had the expression of a fond and indulgent parent, and as he did not rise
      to the defense of his pet team when I called them “miserable brutes” I
      knew his pride, at least, had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see,” he resumed, “your new sewing machine and some other freight was
      at the station, so when I found the Lawtons were not coming I thought I’d
      bring it over. I had the crystal clock, too.” Owen looked so sheepish I
      had to laugh, although the clock had been a wedding present which we had
      sent up to the jeweler to be regulated.
    </p>
    <p>“Is it smashed?”</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no,” he reassured me, “but I don’t know how well it will run. I got
      out to close the gate beyond the railroad when a confounded freight engine
      whistled and the horses started. I was holding the reins in my hand, of
      course, and tried to climb in the back of the wagon, but couldn’t make it
      on account of the load. I ran along the side until the horses went so fast
      I fell down and when they began to drag me I let go of the reins. They ran
      all over that inclosure, the wagon upset and canned tomatoes, sewing
      machine and crystal clock were strewn everywhere. I caught the horses
      finally, but the wagon was smashed so I had to walk back to Becker’s, get
      his wagon and pick up all the freight—that’s what delayed me. I’m
      dreadfully sorry about the sewing machine and the clock, but I don’t
      believe they are much hurt.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very contrite, was my husband, but it didn’t last long, that sense
      of duty was too insistent. A very short time after, he was alone, driving
      another team, with a horse he had just bought, tied to the tug. The new
      horse, frightened at a dead animal in the lane, jumped, broke the tug,
      plunged forward, pulled the neck yoke off, the buggy tongue stuck into the
      ground as the horses ran, the buggy heaved up in the air and pitched Owen
      out. It landed so close to a fence post his head was scratched, but he
      might have been killed. As long as he had escaped, this runaway had its
      amusing side, too. He was bringing home a quantity of china nest-eggs
      which followed when he was thrown out, and he said for a minute it fairly
      snowed nest-eggs; the ground was white with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen and his horses! I never could decide whether it was more
      nerve-racking to go with him or stay behind, so I usually took the chance
      and went. The experiences we had! I wonder we ever survived that
      horse-breaking period, but only once did we face a fate from which there
      seemed only one chance in a thousand of escaping with our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were driving a buckskin horse Owen had just bought and a newly broken
      mare, a handsome, high spirited creature called Beauty. She danced and she
      pranced and forged ahead of the new horse which became nervous and excited
      in trying to keep up with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were going up a long hill. Beauty was pulling and tugging on the bit
      when suddenly she gave a toss to her head and to our horror we saw the
      bridle fall back around her neck. The bit had broken. Like a flash she was
      off, the other horse running with her. Owen spoke to them. He wound the
      reins about his arms and pulled on them with all his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the hill there was a fairly level space where Owen tried to
      circle them, hoping to tire them out, but he had no control over Beauty
      and she wheeled about starting back over the road we had come, the buggy
      bouncing and swaying behind. There was a fence corner with an old post
      standing about ten feet from it. The horses headed straight for it. I
      closed my eyes, expecting that we would be wrecked, but they turned and
      raced across a gulch, the buggy lurched, tipped, struck one side and then
      the other, but by a miracle did not upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that Owen was trying to head them into a fence and braced myself for
      the shock, realizing that he hoped to entangle them in the barbed wire and
      so throw them, but just as we reached it Beauty veered to one side almost
      overturning the buggy. We were so close the skirt of Owen’s fur coat
      caught on the barbs and was instantly torn to ribbons and we heard the
      vibrating “ping” of the wire along its entire length as the wheels struck
      the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On and on the maddened horses raced, up hills, down long slopes, through
      gulches in which it seemed we must be wrecked, until at length we reached
      the crest of a hill at the bottom of which, angling with the fence, ran a
      deep gulch with high cut banks. We knew that if the frantic horses reached
      the edge of that bank at the rate we were going there was no escape for us
      and we should plunge over the embankment with the horses. To jump was
      impossible. I was in despair, realizing that Owen, pulling on the horses
      with all his might, was nearly exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Owen, isn’t there something I can do?” It was the first time a word had
      been spoken.
    </p>
    <p>“Pull on the Buckskin,” he answered quickly.</p>
    <p>
      I leaned forward and seized the rein with both hands as far down as I
      could reach and threw myself back with all my weight. The Buckskin was
      pulled back on his haunches, Beauty stopped. Owen handed me the reins,
      another moment he was at their heads calling to me to jump. In that
      instant before jumping I lived an eternity, for if the horses had started
      again I should have gone to certain death alone.
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      I was so weak with fright and sudden relief when I felt the firm earth
      under my feet I could scarcely stand but I had to get to the Buckskin’s
      head and hold on to him, for Owen had his hands full with Beauty, who
      began to rear and plunge. It was no time for nerves. The horses were
      finally unhitched. Owen led Beauty and I, the Buckskin. Leaving the buggy
      on the edge of that yawning gulch, we walked the five miles back to the
      ranch.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch07">VII—THE MEASURE OF A MAN</h2>
    <p>
      The Bohms had gone. The last load of furniture, upon which old Bohm
      perched like an ill-omened bird, had disappeared through the gate on the
      top of the hill. At last, after six months of vexation and trouble, Owen
      and I could live our own life and run the ranch without interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bohm had tried to wriggle out of every clause in his contract. He had
      delayed gathering and turning over the stock by every means and had
      invented a thousand excuses for staying on from week to week. It had made
      it very difficult and had exasperated Owen. If he hadn’t been wise and
      patient beyond words, Bohm’s bones long before would have mingled with
      those of his reputed victims in the old root cellar. I had a different end
      planned for him each day, but none seemed really fitting. Owen had gone on
      in his own way, however, insisting upon every part of the contract being
      fulfilled and reducing Bohm to impotent rage by his quiet firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bohm had recovered from her “fainting spells” and her husband was
      furious to think he had sold the ranch. In desperation he finally sent to
      San Francisco for his brother, who was a lawyer, to see if there was any
      possibility of getting out of the contract. The “Judge” was a nice old
      chap, who looked like an amiable Mormon with a long beard. He soon settled
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, Jim, you wanted to sell out, you signed the contract and you have
      your money. You’ll have to stay with your bargain now, whether you like it
      or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We always remembered him kindly for this and for a story he told. We had
      been discussing the Chinese as servants and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I had one for two years, but I don’t want any more. I want to know
      what I’m eating and with those heathen you are never sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It had been raining very hard one day when Wong came to me in the
      afternoon and said:
    </p>
    <p>“‘Judge, him laining outside, me gottee no meat for dinner.’</p>
    <p>
      “I told him that we would do without meat for it was raining too hard for
      anyone to go out who didn’t have to. Wong looked dejected for he liked
      meat. He turned to go out of the room, when his eyes fell on the cat. His
      face brightened with a sudden inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>“‘Have meat for dinner! Kill’em cat!’</p>
    <p>“Kill the cat! What on earth do you mean?</p>
    <p>
      “‘Less, kill’em cat,’ he repeated in a matter of fact tone, ‘him sick
      anyhow.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      We had asked the Bohms to take their meals with us, but only Mrs. Bohm
      came to our table. Bohm preferred to eat with the men. We suspected that
      he was trying to cause trouble. Charley unconsciously confirmed our
      suspicions. He was always conversational and seized the opportunity to
      talk while fixing my window screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Say, Mrs. Brook, you’d orter seen Bill this mornin’. He was eatin’
      flapjacks to beat time and was just reachin’ for more, when old Bohm, with
      that mean way of his, began slammin’ Mr. Brook. He was sayin’ you folks
      thought you was too good to eat in the kitchen with us common fellers and
      had to have a separate dinin’ room, when Bill just riz up out of his chair
      so sudden it went over backwards, and believe me, his eyes had sparks in
      ’em when he came back at the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Tain’t that the Brooks think that they’re too good, but there’s some
      folks too stinkin’ common for anybody to eat with’—and out of the door he
      walked and all the boys fol-lered him, leavin’ Bohm alone there facin’ all
      them flapjacks. I reckon he’d a rather faced them flapjacks than Bill,
      though,—Gee, Bill was some hot,” and Charley’s blue eyes sparkled at the
      reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly as I thought; the boys despised Bohm and were absolutely
      loyal to Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this episode, Owen had a long talk with Bill and a short, heated
      interview with Bohm, which resulted in the old man’s reluctant, but hasty,
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew a long breath of relief when I saw the last wagon disappear and
      looked up fully expecting to see the dove of peace pluming herself on our
      roof-tree. But apparently doves in the cattle country never alight,—they
      just pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen had bought several thousand acres of land from the railroad. A car of
      barbed wire for the fence, which was to encircle the entire ranch, was at
      the station. Our land was now in one solid block with the exception of a
      few acres of Government land which could only be acquired by homestead
      entry. This limited acreage in the great checkerboard was all that
      remained of the “free range.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Owen was served with a notice by the United States
      Marshal forbidding him to build the fence. It would enclose Government
      land. Every mile of the proposed fence would have been on ground which he
      had bought, paid for, and on which he was paying taxes—but still—he could
      not fence it. “Government land must remain uninclosed.” It made no
      difference, apparently, what happened to the cattleman whose money was
      tied up in property he could not use. Government land must remain free and
      open to the public. But, while those few acres of free range remained open
      to the public, thousands of acres of our unprotected land remained open
      also. Everyone used it. The ranchmen for miles around, learning that Owen
      was forbidden to fence, gathered all their cattle and threw them onto our
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very serious problem. Our range was being destroyed, the grass
      was eaten off so closely nothing remained for winter range. Our
      full-blooded Hereford breeding stock was of little use to us. All our
      money was invested in land and cattle and there was only one thing left to
      do,—put riders on our range to drive the other cattle off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this solution of the problem the dove of peace promptly departed and
      we entered upon a long, hard struggle for the possession and use of what
      was our own. Owen was faced, not only with financial failure, but absolute
      ruin. The future was far from bright, but when an old school-mate came
      with her husband to visit us it seemed positively brilliant by contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Joice and I had been devoted friends for years. The summer before we
      had spent in Europe, where I had left her, deep in the study of Art, to
      which she intended “to devote” her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is so commonplace to marry, Esther,” these were her parting words;
      “any woman can marry—but so few can have a real career.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice’s “career” had abruptly ended in “commonplace matrimony,” for she
      had just married a Mr. Van Winkle from Brooklyn, a man I had never met.
      They were touring the West and were most anxious to include our ranch. I
      was very eager to see them so I wrote, urging her to come, but asked her
      to let us know when to expect them, so there would be no mistake about our
      being at the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was particularly anxious to have them see ranch life at its best for
      they were our first guests. The house looked very attractive with all our
      own furniture and wedding presents in place, but I thought the guest room
      floor might be improved so I painted it Saturday afternoon. Then
      everything went wrong: the wind-mill pump failed to work, the whole pipe
      had to be pulled out of the well; we were without running water in the
      house and couldn’t have a fire in the kitchen range, so rations were
      extremely light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper, consisting chiefly of sardines, awaited Owen, who was trying to
      get some of the grease off his hands, when a homesteader by the name of
      Hamm, his wife, sister and five children drove up. He had come to see Owen
      on business and they were invited in to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was lengthened and reset, more sardines were opened and we were
      just ready to sit down when my Aunt, who was standing near the window,
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>“Who on earth is that!”</p>
    <p>
      Who, indeed! Alice Joice and her husband with a team they had hired at the
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a strong heart I did not faint, but left Auntie to help the maid
      make the necessary additions to the table—and sardines, while Owen and I
      hurried out to greet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hello, dearie, here we are,” Alice called from the wagon as I approached.
      “Clarence and I thought it would be such fun to surprise you.
      How-do-you-do, Mr. Brook, I want you to meet my husband, Mr. Van Winkle.”
      Alice jumped off the step and threw herself into my arms. “Oh, Esther,
      isn’t this fun?” Gay, inconsequent Alice, from her city home, never
      considered for a moment that a surprise <i>could</i> be anything but
      joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had met him in Egypt, I should have known that her husband’s name was
      Van Winkle—Clarence Van Winkle, it couldn’t have been anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pale and tall and thin and rigid. The inflexibility of the combined
      ancestral spines had united in his back bone. He might break, he could
      never bend. My imagination failed when I tried to picture the meeting
      between the heir to the Van Winkle name and the Hamms. It was far worse
      than anything I could ever have imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was very sweet; she talked all the time, patted the five little
      Hamms and won their mother’s heart by asking their names and ages, but in
      acknowledging the introduction Clarence only bowed slightly, a movement
      which required great effort, then relapsed into silence immediately,
      scrutinizing the Hamm family through his glasses as though they were rare
      animals in a Zoo. Mrs. Hamm and her sister were stupefied and did not
      speak a word, but Mr. Hamm, a truly sociable person from Oklahoma,
      continually addressed Clarence as “young feller,” which produced the same
      effect as a violent chill, and when he joyously jogged a Van Winkle elbow
      to emphasize some pleasantry, Clarence firmly moved his chair out of reach
      of the defiling touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice ate everything and did not stop talking for a moment. Clarence
      refused everything but a cracker, which he munched in silence. Suddenly he
      turned white and left the table. Owen escorted him out-of-doors while
      Alice and I followed. He was faint, just faint, and collapsed weakly onto
      a garden seat. Alice said it was the Denver water, but I suspected
      unassimilated Hamm. Owen stayed with him and Alice and I returned to
      finish supper. The Hamms left soon after and Clarence gradually revived
      under the influence of Owen’s New England accent and Scotch whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once I thought of the freshly painted guest-room floor. I explained
      the situation to Alice and we went up to see if it was dry. It was, but
      the smell of paint was most evident. Alice gave a few sniffs and said
      apologetically:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m dreadfully sorry, Esther, but Clarence couldn’t possibly sleep here.
      He is so sensitive to odors of any kind.” I was reminded of a faint aroma
      which had clung to the Hamm garments. “If there is another room we can
      occupy, I think it would be better.” Alice was accustomed to hotels. I
      offered our room; it was reluctantly but finally accepted, the scion of
      the Van Winkles must not breathe paint. All the things from the guest-room
      were put in our room and ours were moved up to the guest-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before they retired Alice confided to me that Clarence had had some
      temperature in Denver and the Doctor thought he might be threatened with
      typhoid fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I really believe, Esther, if Clarence has any temperature in the morning
      we had better go back to Denver.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I reassured her as I bade her good-night and then sought Owen. I was
      beginning to have some temperature myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Owen, if Clarence Van Winkle has a thousandth of a degree of temperature
      in the morning don’t tell him that he’ll be all right; let him go back to
      Denver or anywhere else he pleases. Imagine that man with typhoid, here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Alice appeared at breakfast alone. Clarence had no
      temperature, but he felt weak and thought he had better stay in bed. He
      continued to feel weak for three days, Alice dancing attendance white the
      rest of us tried to get the household and water running again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Clarence finally emerged from his seclusion, he was in high spirits,
      positively buoyant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, now I want to see everything, all the cattle, the cow-boys,
      branding, dehorning, a round-up and what is it you call it? Oh, yes,
      ‘broncho busting’. We have to go back to Denver tomorrow, you know.” He
      had to stop for want of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice beamed fondly upon her enthusiastic bridegroom. Mine looked far from
      enthusiastic. Owen was a perfect host but he could not give a
      demonstration of a year’s work in one day. The horse-breaking was over for
      the season and the branded and dehorned cattle scattered over miles of
      country. This he endeavored to explain to Clarence who made no attempt to
      conceal his disappointment nor his petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, how unfortunate. I’ve heard so much of the fascination of ranch life
      I thought I’d like to see a little of it. I thought you had broncho
      busting or something interesting or entertaining going on every day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen bit his lip. He was busy beyond words but he dropped everything and
      afternoon we took our guests for a drive over the ranch. The wagon was new
      and rattled and, wishing to spare Clarence’s delicate sensibilities, Owen
      put on some washers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the middle of the prairie miles from the house, Clarence had
      recovered his good humor since he was “actually seeing something”, as he
      tactfully expressed it, when one of the wheels began to drag. The washers
      proved to be too tight, we had a hot spindle. There was nothing to do but
      sit there in the blazing sun while the two men took off the wheel, removed
      a washer or two and greased the spindle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn’t have missed it, the mere thought of that scene was a joy to me
      for months afterwards. Clarence Van Winkle red and perspiring from the
      effort of lifting a wheel, wiping his greasy hands on a piece of dirty
      waste! Alice’s face was a study. I had to keep my eyes fixed on the
      landscape after one look over the side of the wagon. I was afraid I should
      laugh out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day they left Bill drove us all to the station. We just made the
      train, which was standing on the track as we arrived. Owen hurried to
      check the Van Winkle’s baggage. Bill had to stay with the horses. Alice
      and I had all the wraps, which left Clarence to carry two dress suit cases
      across the tracks. His eyes were fixed on the porter and he was hurrying
      toward the Pullman when he stubbed his toe on one rail, sprawled all the
      way across the track and hit his neck on the second rail. The suit cases
      flew in one direction, his hat in another, his glasses fell off and his
      watch dropped out of his pocket. Alice and I rushed to the rescue, the
      porter assisted Clarence to his feet and picked up the suit cases, we
      gathered up the rest of the articles while Clarence stood in the middle of
      the track rubbing his knees, to the great amusement of the passengers.
      Alice went up to him when suddenly he screwed his face up as a child does
      before it begins to cry, threw both arms around her neck and buried his
      face on her shoulder. The conductor terminated the scene by calling “All
      aboard”. Clarence limped to the train, rubbing his neck, and the last we
      saw was Alice holding all the wraps, the hat, glasses and watch, waving to
      us from the vestibule and Clarence comfortably seated in the Pullman
      smiling a wan farewell through the window. As the train with its precious
      freight was lost to sight around a curve, Owen and I began to laugh. We
      laughed until we were so weak we could scarcely get into the wagon. Bill’s
      face was perfectly serious, but his eyes had a little twinkle in them as
      he said with his slow drawl:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord, Mrs. Brook, I’m glad that young man married that girl. He’d orter
      have somebody look after him. A poor little goslin’ feller like that ain’t
      got no business goin’ round alone.”
    </p>
    <p>Bill always sized up a situation in the fewest possible words.</p>
    <p>
      During the drive back to the ranch I thought of Alice and her future by
      the side of a man of that type. Our future was uncertain enough, but if
      trouble and vicissitudes were our portion, at least I had someone with
      whom to share them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tex had been away for several weeks and we were surprised to see him at
      the gate as we drove up. He looked very serious as he asked Owen if he
      might speak with him and Owen looked more serious when he came out of the
      office after their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>“What is it, Owen? Something is wrong. Please tell me.”</p>
    <p>Owen took me by the arm and we walked up and down under the trees.</p>
    <p>
      “Tex came over to tell me, Esther, that I am to be arrested for ‘driving
      cattle off the range.’ Technically, it’s a serious charge, carrying a
      heavy fine and—” he paused—“imprisonment, but don’t worry, my dear,” as he
      felt me start a little at his last words, “it’s listed on the statute
      books as a criminal offence, connected with rustling, but that can’t hold
      in this case. It’s a ‘frame-up’ to give me trouble, that’s all. It might
      have been serious but Tex heard of it and came to warn me just in time.
      There’s been a plot to eat me out and now they want to drive me out. I’m
      going in to Denver to see my lawyer tomorrow. I’m more troubled on your
      account than anything else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t worry about me, Owen, we’re going to stay in this country and fight
      it out to the end. I’ll face anything, as long as you don’t cry,” and we
      went into the house laughing, as we thought of Clarence Van Winkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserable experience which followed was sufficiently serious, even
      after the charge had been changed to one of minor character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen was arrested on our anniversary. I went his bond. There was a long,
      expensive law-suit which we lost, the Judge contending that if a man
      wished to protect his land he should fence it. It was explained that the
      Government had forbidden it, but the Judge said that did not affect the
      verdict in this case. Owen paid the damages awarded by the Court, we
      gathered together our sixteen cow-puncher witnesses who had been staying
      with us at one of the largest hotels in Denver, an event for the
      cow-punchers, and returned to the ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Owen weep on my shoulder? He set his lips a little more firmly and his
      face had an added sternness as he looked across those miles of rolling
      prairie he owned but which now were utterly useless.
    </p>
    <p>He broke the silence at last. His voice had a different tone.</p>
    <p>
      “I am going to have the use of my own land. They shan’t keep me out of it
      any longer. I am going to sell off all the cattle and put in sheep. Then
      we’ll see! With herders we don’t need fences and cattle won’t graze where
      sheep have ranged.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      Thus with the first year of our marriage, the first chapter of our ranch
      experience ended and a totally different life began.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch08">VIII—THE SHEEP BUSINESS</h2>
    <p>
      With the coming of the sheep everything was changed. It was like living in
      a different age, almost as though we had slipped back hundreds of years
      into Biblical times and had come into intimate association with Jacob and
      Joseph. With the advent of the wool or lamb buyers there was a sudden
      transition to the more commercial atmosphere of the twentieth century, but
      it was so fleeting our pastoral existence was scarcely interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few of our old men had gone, Tex among them. He left with regret, but as
      he said—
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord knows I hate to go, Mr. Brook, but cattle’s all I know and an old
      cow man ain’t got no business around sheep; they just naturally despise
      each other.” And he went up into Montana where the cattle business still
      flourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the other men stayed on, however, to ride the fence lines, look
      after the horses and do the various things about the ranch, but the days
      of branding, dehorning and round-ups were past and the cow-puncher was
      replaced by “camp tenders”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheep were trailed all the way from New Mexico. Steve, who spoke
      Spanish, was foreman, and with three of the other men on horseback had
      come up the trail with the sheep and the soft-voiced Mexican herders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their entire camp equipment was skillfully packed on diminutive burros. It
      was somewhat startling to see what appeared to be animated wood-piles,
      water-casks, rolls of bedding or dish-pans bobbing about over the woolly
      backs of the sheep, until a parting in the band revealed the legs and
      lowered head of a sleepy-eyed burro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The herders spoke no English and it was so charming to receive a gleaming
      smile and low bow while being addressed as “Padron” and “Señora” that we
      plunged into the study of their musical language forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each herder was in charge of a band of from fifteen hundred to twenty-five
      hundred sheep. Two herders occupied a camp, but the sheep were placed in
      separate corrals and, in order to give the various bands ample pasturage,
      the camps were placed miles apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning the sheep were driven out, the herders taking their
      bands in opposite directions. All day long the flock quietly grazed over
      the prairie, the Mexican with his dog at his feet standing like a sentinel
      on a hill from which he could overlook his entire band and ward off any
      prowling coyote whose approach was heralded by a sudden scurry among the
      sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eternal vigilance, faithfulness and good judgment were the essential
      qualities in a herder, judgment in the handling of the sheep, in the
      selection of the best grass and water, the time for taking them out and
      bringing them back to the camp. The herders were not supposed to meet and
      talk together for while they were engrossed in conversation or out of
      sight of the sheep the two bands might become mixed, a very serious thing
      when the ewes were accompanied by their lambs, for when the bands were
      separated again the lamb might be in one band and its mother in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lonely life, but one for which Mexicans are especially suited.
      They lack the initiative of the Anglo-Saxons, they are naturally tranquil,
      slow of speech and action and content to do nothing—gentle children from
      the land of Mañana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scattered over the prairie, the sheep from a distance looked like mere
      dots so closely resembling the clumps of weeds, it was necessary to locate
      the herder before they could be identified. He looked like a solitary
      fence post placed on the top of a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mexicans were most gracious and responsive, so delighted to receive a
      visit from the Padron that it was a joy to talk with them. We were never
      certain just what we had said, to be sure, but the effect of our halting,
      broken sentences of Spanish appeared so pleasing, we were convinced that
      if we could only converse fluently our words would become immortal.
      Urbanity was most contagious. Owen and I made deep bows to the herders, we
      almost bowed to the sheep in an over-mastering desire to equal the
      politeness of Ramon, Fidel, Francisco or Tranquilino. What names! The
      atmosphere of the ranch became so poetic and romantic I should not have
      been surprised to see Owen adopt long hair and a flowing tie. After a day
      spent in visiting the sheep camps I returned in an ecstatic mood. I almost
      fancied myself the reincarnated spirit of Bo-Peep or Ramona but alas, my
      true identity was always disclosed as soon as I reached the house—I was
      only “the Missus”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the sheep business was fascinating, and best of all
      successful. The question of the range was settled. We had the use of our
      own land and our rights were respected. The customary feud between the
      sheepman and the cattle owners was avoided, since our sheep were always
      kept within the limits of the land which we owned. From being the object
      of hatred and vilification, Owen became a personage; his opinion quoted,
      his method of handling sheep emulated.

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      There were a few sheep men in the country who had made an indifferent
      success. They had scoffed at Owen’s practice of selling off all the lambs
      in the autumn and maintaining the number of his sheep by additional
      purchases but, when they found how small his losses were, they promptly
      adopted his plan and even some of the old-time cattle men put in sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of the law suit had certainly proved to be the turning point in
      the history of the Brook family. Our popularity increased so rapidly it
      was amusing. Bill expressed what I felt as I met him riding through the
      meadow.
    </p>
    <p>“Have you been riding the fence lines, Bill?”</p>
    <p>
      “Yes’m, but it’s just takin’ exercise for my health. There ain’t nothin’
      wrong any more. Since you folks got the world by the tail and a down-hill
      pull, everybody’s huntin’ around seein’ what they can do to make it
      pleasant for you. I notice the Three Circle outfit don’t go round no more
      leavin’ all the gates open and when we get a fence line staked out, the
      stakes ain’t all pulled up by mornin’.”
    </p>
    <p>“It is peaceful, isn’t it?”</p>
    <p>
      “Peaceful,” echoed Bill, with feeling, “I’m so chuck full of peace I can’t
      hardly hold any more. I’ll bet if a feller was to hit me, I’d only
      ‘baa-a’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a vast amount of “Baa-ing” going on at the ranch, where Mary and
      I were raising a few score orphan lambs on the bottle. There was a
      voracious chorus whenever we appeared. They jumped all over us and as soon
      as they got hold of the nipple of the bottle they flopped down on their
      knees and did not release it until they had gulped down the last drop of
      milk, after which they stood up, their little sides sticking out as though
      they had been stuffed. As much care had to be exercised with the bottles,
      the temperature and quantity of the milk as though we had been feeding so
      many babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no milk at the outside camps and no one to care for the poor
      abandoned lambs whose frivolous young mothers refused to own them, leaving
      them to starve. Occasionally an old ewe of truly maternal instinct could
      be fooled into adopting one of these little “dogies” or “bums”. The skin
      of her dead lamb was taken off and slipped over the orphan, which was
      joyfully accepted because of its smell!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lambs made their appearance in May, the bands were separated, we
      had additional herders and they had to be more watchful for “Spring lamb”
      is also very tempting to coyotes. It was easy for a herder to lose ten or
      twenty lambs, for the little things congregate behind rocks or clumps of
      weeds and go to sleep, are overlooked when the sheep are driven back to
      the camp in the evening, and become the victims of those prairie wolves
      which continually lurk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes when we were driving, a tiny white speck would come racing after
      the wagon, a lamb, which had been left behind. Lambs are such senseless
      little things, when they are frightened they will adopt any moving object
      in lieu of a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      We pulled them out of prairie-dog holes into which they had thrust their
      heads and become fastened by having the loose earth fall in about their
      necks—they were troublesome but so appealing and amusing, they were a
      never-ending source of entertainment from the first moment they appeared,
      a tiny body supported on long, wabbly legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they grew stronger “playful as a lamb” acquired a new meaning. They
      capered and they bucked, they raced around the corral in the evening when
      the ewes were contentedly lying down, they frisked about on the backs of
      their patient mothers, they jumped stiff-legged, and in a wild excess of
      joy bounded into the air giving a cork-screw twist to their hindquarters,
      which produced a most ludicrous effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old quotations from the Bible came to have added significance; as the
      shearer held a poor frightened sheep between his knees and rapidly clipped
      off the fleece with his gleaming shears, there was not a sound if a clumsy
      movement cut a deep gash in the tender flesh; the “sheep before her
      shearer was dumb” indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent days in the shearing sheds watching the proceedings from a pile of
      wool sacks or passing out small metal disks in exchange for the fleeces
      the shearers turned in. At the end of the day the disks were counted and
      each shearer credited with the number of sheep he had shorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fleeces were rolled and tied separately, then thrown up to a man on a
      platform, who packed them in a long sack which was suspended from the top
      of a high frame. As it was filled, it was taken down, sewed up and rolled
      into the end of the shed to remain until later in the season when the wool
      was sold and hauled to the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was certainly peaceful compared to what it had been, but there was
      little danger of our becoming “on weed”, as a certain retired cattle-man
      expressed it after a short sojourn in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambing, shearing and dipping followed in rapid succession. The herders
      cooked for themselves and once a week the wagons were piled with supplies
      and provisions which were left at each camp. In a huge store-room were
      kept quantities of salt-pork, sugar, dried fruits, coffee, flour and other
      groceries. Flour was bought by the ton and everything else in proportion.
      Making out the orders, having all the freight hauled the sixteen miles
      from the railroad, checking it out and keeping the camps supplied, were
      only details but it was the multitude of detail which filled the days and
      kept us from becoming “on weed”. We issued the supplies to the
      camp-tenders ourselves, after one of them had filled all of the Mexicans’
      cans with gasoline instead of coal-oil, because “it kind’a had the same
      smell.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless we chanced to have guests, for weeks at a time the only women I saw
      were those in our employ, but I resented having any of my friends think of
      my life as “dull” or “lonely”. On the contrary it was fascinating, full of
      incident, rich in experience which money could not buy. Living so close to
      the great heart of nature during those years on the plains, the vision of
      life partook of their breadth and a new sense of values replaced old,
      artificial standards. To be alone on the vast prairie was to gain a new
      conception of infinity and—eternity.

      The Mexicans stayed on the ranch about nine months, then returned to their
      homes for a short visit. They were the most invariable creatures I ever
      knew. When they departed for Taos or Trinidad or Antonito, perhaps in
      July, they would announce on what date and by what train they would return
      in October. That was the end of it, and upon the appointed day in October
      someone would meet the designated train from which the smiling herder
      alighted. They never failed and they never left until another herder was
      there to take care of the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer during this vacation period, eight new herders came to replace
      eight that were going home. They were a fierce looking lot from a
      different section of the country. They had been on the ranch only a short
      time when Steve began to have trouble with them. They were late getting
      their sheep out in the morning, they drove them too rapidly and brought
      them in too early in the evening. In a few weeks the sheep began to lose
      flesh and show the effects of bad handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomers disobeyed all orders, unless Steve happened to be on the
      spot. He had to watch them constantly. He came up to a camp unexpectedly
      one noon and found two of these Mexicans ready to sit down to a dinner
      they had just cooked. It was an invariable rule that the herders should
      take a lunch with them, for their mid-day meal, and not return to the
      camp. They had left their sheep alone, so Steve made them leave their
      dinner and go back to their bands, while he stayed to make sure they did
      not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to discharge them until new herders could be brought
      from New Mexico and he and Owen talked over the situation at length that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning Steve went out on another trip of inspection. About
      two o’clock he rode into the yard, his face covered with blood from a deep
      gash in his head. He fell from his horse into Owen’s arms. We brought him
      in, washed off the blood, gave him a stimulant and waited until he was
      able to tell us what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It developed that as he came in sight of the camp he saw four of the
      Mexicans outside of the cabin. They stood motionless as he approached,
      then began to hurl rocks at him. One hit his horse and he was nearly
      thrown but managed to keep his seat. He was struck several times on the
      body. Although realizing that the Mexicans intended to kill him, he jumped
      off his horse and went toward them. A rock struck his head, but with
      undaunted courage he picked up some of the rocks and threw them back at
      the herders. They had not expected that turn to the affair and ran into
      the cabin. Steve was unarmed and too badly hurt, single handed, to deal
      with the Mexicans, so he got on his horse, with difficulty, and came back
      to the ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing I knew, Owen, Bill and Fred, each carrying a gun, got into
      the wagon and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When anything happened it came with such suddenness there was never
      opportunity for questions, besides, my association with men had taught me
      the value of silence—in an emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few hours Owen and Fred came back. They had met the eight new herders
      walking into the ranch to “quit”. They walked back to their respective
      camps instead, their pace accelerated by a loaded gun pointing at their
      backs. The cabins were searched, several villainous looking knives
      confiscated and eight subdued cut-throats returned to the peaceful
      occupation of herding sheep, under Bill’s watchful eye and loaded gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen said that it wasn’t at all necessary for the Mexicans to understand
      English since Bill’s few remarks were sufficiently lurid to attract their
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until other herders could be brought to the ranch, one white man, always
      armed, stayed at each camp, constantly on guard lest the vindictive
      herders set fire to the camps or kill the sheep. These were no gentle
      children from the land of Mañana; we discovered they were desperate
      characters from Old Mexico, to whom murder was second nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill’s opinion of the sheep business after his brief experience in the
      camps could only be published in an expurgated edition. He hated the
      Mexicans, he hated the sheep, he hated everything connected with them.
      After seeing his charges safely on board a southbound train, he returned
      to the ranch with all the joy of an exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve been up against tough men, Mrs. Brook, but that bunch is the worst I
      ever seen. They’re just like a pack of coyotes, grinnin’ and sneakin’ up
      behind you, waitin’ ’til they git a chance to finish you. Between listnin’
      to the grass grow and pickin’ off sheep ticks, I got plumb locoed settin’
      there watchin’ ’em. I jest had to feel my skin every once in a while to be
      sure I wasn’t growin’ wool.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch09">IX—THE UNEXPECTED</h2>
    <p>
      If there is anything in suggestion, Carlyle was responsible for the whole
      affair, otherwise <i>why</i> should we have deferred our drive until the
      late afternoon and selected <i>Sartor Resartus</i> of all books to read
      aloud after lunch?
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen wanted to visit one of the sheep camps to examine the corrals before
      having the hay stacked there for winter use and he urged us to go with
      him. His invitation was joyfully accepted. For many weeks we had scarcely
      left the ranch as Owen’s Mother, who was with us, had been desperately
      ill. The crisis had passed, however, so we did not hesitate to go off for
      a few hours, leaving Madame Brook with her nurse. My aunt, Owen’s sister
      and her two children were at the ranch also, and after so many weeks of
      anxiety we all felt the relaxation and joyously climbed into the wagon
      when Owen drove up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were summer and winter camps for the sheep and our objective point
      was an old place, acquired with the ranch, which had been converted into a
      winter camp. During the summer it was unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove along laughing and talking. Owen’s nephew carried his gun and
      kept a sharp lookout for coyotes. It was a glorious day and we were in the
      mood to appreciate all its beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meadows, waist deep in native hay, were flecked with the gold of the
      prairie sun flowers. The wild roses grew in tangled masses everywhere,
      their perfume mingled with the odor of the sage which yielded up its
      aromatic sweetness as the wheels crushed the silvery leaves. The plains
      were mottled with the shade of fleecy clouds which floated lazily across
      the sky, the changing lights flooded the hills with dazzling sunshine,
      then veiled them softly with faint cloud shadows. A delicate haze hung
      over the more distant hills, and behind the mountains thunderheads were
      gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road ran directly past the camp and long before we reached it we could
      see the old house, forbidding in its isolation, standing on a high mesa
      above the creek. It had been built years before by a settler named La
      Monte, whose footsteps misfortune had dogged until she overtook him at
      last. His wife deserted him and, broken in heart and fortune, he had left
      the country. Bohm held a mortgage on the place and it had passed into his
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      An air of abandonment surrounded the camp even in winter when it was
      occupied, but during the summer when it was totally deserted the ghosts of
      dead happiness stalked unheeded through the silent rooms. Rank weeds
      filled the yards, the plaintive notes of the wood-doves in the
      cotton-woods by the creek and the weird, haunting howl of the coyotes were
      the only sounds to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tale connecting old Bohm with the La Monte tragedy for which
      an affair with Mrs. La Monte was responsible. We were some distance from
      the house, the rest of the party were intent on watching a big jack-rabbit
      which was bounding lightly across the prairie, but I was thinking of the
      wretched story which the sight of the old house always recalled, when the
      door was slowly opened and a naked man paused for a moment on the
      threshold then walked down the steps into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave a gasp, my eyes fixed on that advancing figure, the others looked
      around but in that instant the man had seen us and dropped down into the
      tall weeds, by which he was completely hidden.
    </p>
    <p>“What’s the matter?” Owen asked, surprised by my exclamation.</p>
    <p>
      “Why, Owen, a man without any clothes on just came out of that door and is
      there in the weeds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen turned toward the yard, there was no one in sight; he looked at me in
      amazement. He knew I must be in earnest! I was not given to “seeing
      things”.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, that’s absurd, how could you imagine anyone being out here in this
      deserted place miles and miles from the railroad?”
    </p>
    <p>
      We were just opposite the house and as if in response to Owen’s question
      the head and naked breast of a man rose up from behind the weeds. His face
      was crimson and the thick, black disheveled hair gave him such an aspect
      of wildness we were appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen stopped the horses, the man rose to his feet, calmly looked at us,
      then turned and walked slowly into the house.
    </p>
    <p>We were speechless. It was like a sudden apparition.</p>
    <p>After a moment Owen passed the lines to me.</p>
    <p>“Here, Esther, hold the horses while I go in and investigate.”</p>
    <p>
      “Be careful,” was all I could say. There was a chorus of “Don’ts” from the
      back seat as he got out of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the gun. “Gordon, take your gun and go after your uncle. I
      know that man is crazy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gordon jumped out and ran toward the house, but before he reached the door
      we heard a loud burst of singing, a curious rendering of “Ta-rah-rah
      boom-de-ahy”. In a moment Owen and Gordon reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, there’s no doubt of his being crazy,” Owen said, “we’ll go to the
      Bosman ranch where I can get someone to come back with me. I can telephone
      the Sheriff from there, too.” Then he told us what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he reached the door the man had put on his outside shirt and
      was standing in the middle of the bedroom floor. He glared at Owen when he
      entered and made no reply when asked what he was doing there, then he
      turned around and walked over to an empty bed frame which stood against
      the wall, got behind it and gradually slipped down underneath. When he was
      lying flat on his back on the floor, his feet toward Owen, he began to
      sing in some broken foreign tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was uncanny and as we drove on toward the creek I could only say “What
      next?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know what on earth can come next,” Owen replied. “This is
      positively the most unexpected and unlikely thing that ever happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to drive down a hill before we crossed the creek and at last lost
      sight of the house, the sound of the wild singing grew more faint and
      finally died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no bridges in the country and while at this time there was no
      flowing water, the sand was wet. We drove down a steep bank into the bed
      of the creek and were almost across when without the slightest warning the
      bottom seemed to drop out of the earth beneath us and the wagon sank down.
    </p>
    <p>“Quicksand!”</p>
    <p>
      There was just time for that one exclamation in concert. Owen gave the
      horses a quick cut with the whip, they sprang forward, caught a footing on
      the solid sand and were safe. He gave them another cut, but pull as they
      would they could not move the wagon, which had sunk to the hubs. The
      double tree broke and the horses were free. Owen and Gordon jumped out on
      the tongue, holding onto the horses and drove them up the bank. There the
      rest of us sat, feeling the wagon sinking slowly farther and farther into
      the deadly, yielding substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of the wagon-pole rested on the firm sand, so by climbing over the
      dashboard holding on to it with one hand I was able to work my own way
      down the wagon tongue until I could grasp an outstretched hand and jump to
      safety. The others followed my example. The danger was past, but we
      trembled as we looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to distinguish quicksand from ordinary sand by its
      appearance, but it will not support the slightest weight. It seems to melt
      into nothing and the sensation is all the more terrifying from its
      suddenness. The first effect is instantaneous, then the engulfment becomes
      more gradual.
    </p>
    <p>We were safe but afoot. Owen took the horses.</p>
    <p>
      “Gordon and I will go on to the Bosmans and get another wagon. We won’t be
      long and you women had better stay here and not walk these three miles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just about to say “all right” when I happened to glance behind me
      and there on the bank, silhouetted quite sharply against the sky, stood
      the figure of a half-clad man.
    </p>
    <p>He was watching every move we made. I pointed to him.</p>
    <p>
      “I think you’d better come with us,” said Owen after one glance, “he might
      decide to investigate,” and off we all trudged down the dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue black masses of cloud were spreading gradually across the sky and
      distant thunder muttered ominously.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      If a bomb had alighted in the centre of the Bosman ranch, where supper was
      in progress, it couldn’t have produced a more startling effect than our
      arrival on foot and the account of our experience. They urged us to spend
      the night, as the storm was rapidly approaching, but we felt we must go
      back with Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bosman hitched our team to one of his wagons, while Owen telephoned to
      the Sheriff. We took a few pieces of bread and meat for the poor demented
      creature at the camp and made another start. Mr. Bosman and his son
      accompanied us on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>We went by a different road to avoid crossing the creek.</p>
    <p>
      It was dark by the time we reached the La Monte place, everything was
      still. The four men, with a lighted lantern, entered the house. A wild
      outburst of singing followed, which told us the same scene was being
      enacted. The men came out almost immediately, talking earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bosman, an old-timer, had recognized the man as Jean La Monte, he had
      spoken to him, had called him by name, but no sign of understanding, not
      one faint glimmer of intelligence had shone from out those wild eyes. Mr.
      Bosman was almost overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s just terrible to see him that way, he was such a good man. Poor old
      La Monte, trouble has sure driven him crazy. How on earth he ever got here
      beats me. There ain’t a thing we can do tonight. We couldn’t handle him if
      he got violent. There never was a stronger man in this country than Jean
      La Monte. My God! It’s awful!”
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was arranged that the Bosmans should go back to their ranch and send
      word to the Sheriff to be up there early in the morning and that Owen
      should have some of our men guard the place during the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Poor devil, I don’t believe he’ll go away. He seemed so suspicious he
      wouldn’t touch the bread, and I believe he’s been here two or three days.
      See you in the morning,” and the Bosmans disappeared in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of the tragedy with which we had so suddenly come in touch,
      weighed upon us. A living ghost connected us with a past in which we had
      no part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after we had left the old place behind, the mad singing followed us,
      except when it was drowned by a sudden crash of thunder. The jagged
      flashes of lightning illuminated the heavens for a brief second, then left
      the world shrouded in an impenetrable darkness. Rather than risk going
      through the creek a second time, we had decided to cut across country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prairies were broken by deep gullies washed and torn by the fury of
      the summer storms. By day, driving was difficult; by night, it was
      hazardous in the extreme, and after a blinding flash which fairly tore the
      heavens apart, we were forced to stop the horses for fear of driving into
      an unseen gulch. The horses, headed toward home and excited and nervous,
      were hard to control. We drove along in silence, our staring eyes trying
      to pierce the darkness. It was so dangerous that at last I got out and
      walked in front of the horses. I could not see; I could only know from the
      contour of the ground when we were near a gulch or by my outstretched hand
      tell when we were near the wires of a fence. After a time Gordon took my
      place, and all the way one or the other walked before the team. The
      lightning and thunder were terrific, but still it did not rain. We were
      worn out with fatigue and anxiety when we finally reached the ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve was standing with his saddle horse at the crossing of the creek,
      swinging a lighted lantern. When he heard the sound of the wheels he gave
      a shout.
    </p>
    <p>“Mr. Brook!”</p>
    <p>“All right,” Owen called back. Steve came towards us.</p>
    <p>
      “What on earth happened? We’ve all been plumb worried to death, and Madame
      Brook, she’s most crazy. I’ve just sent Fred up to the La Monte place to
      look for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “La Monte place!” we exclaimed as several of the boys, attracted by
      Steve’s shout, came up. “Get on your horse,” said Owen, quickly, “and
      overtake him; there’s a madman up there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve did not wait for further instructions, but flung himself on his
      horse and tore off after Fred. We hurried in to reassure Owen’s mother,
      who was nearly frantic. Later, as she bade us “Good-night,” she said very
      seriously: “Owen, as soon as I am able I am going to Denver. I must be
      where it is quiet. I simply cannot stand the excitement here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As the rain began to fall in torrents, we heard the men who had been
      detailed to guard the La Monte place galloping off.
    </p>
    <p>
      An itinerant tailor had pulled into the ranch just before our return, and
      was peacefully sleeping in his wagon. He was awakened when the horses were
      driven into the corral, and came out to learn the cause of the commotion.
      He was so excited when he heard that an insane person was in the vicinity
      he asked to sleep at the bunk house with the men. They tried to laugh him
      out of his fears, but his fright was so genuine they told him to “come
      on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangeness of the whole affair, the combination of circumstances and
      pure nervous and physical exhaustion kept Owen and me awake a long time.
      It seemed I had scarcely fallen asleep when I heard someone knock on the
      door and say:
    </p>
    <p>“Mr. Brook, Mr. Brook.”</p>
    <p>
      I recognized Mary’s voice, and responded for Owen, who was dead asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mrs. Brook, the crazy man is down here at the corral; will you ask Mr.
      Brook to come out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn’t take Owen long to dress. It was about five o’clock, and from the
      window we could see poor old La Monte, still attired in his shirt, sitting
      in the door of the granary playing with a little cotton-wood switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he had escaped the men who had surrounded the place, and how he had
      found his way to our ranch were questions no one could answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first intimation of his presence came in the form of a wild yell from
      the tailor, who had gotten up early and gone down to the corral to feed
      his horses. This brought all the men to the bunk house door as the
      terror-stricken little Jew flung himself into their arms.
    </p>
    <p>“Mein Gott! Dot crazy man iss here.”</p>
    <p>
      “You’re the only crazy man on this ranch,” said Bill, taking him by the
      collar and giving him a shake. “What ails you, anyhow?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, he iss here, he iss here,” wailed the tailor. “He ain’t got on no
      clothes, and we’ll all be kilt.” The boys left him and went out to
      investigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. La Monte was there, and after a futile effort on Bill’s part
      to get him to talk the boys retired to the bunk house and sent for Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gee,” Bill said later, “that feller was the doggondest lookin’ thing I
      ever seen, settin’ there in what was left of his shirt. His legs was all
      tore by the fence wires or brambles, his teeth was chatterin’ and he was
      just blue with cold. His eyes had a look in ’em that give me the shivers.
      I don’t wonder he scart that there Jew into a fit. I wasn’t very anxious
      to come clost to him, neither. I ain’t scart of anything that’s human, but
      he ain’t human, goin’ ’round folks dressed like that.” Bill was a stickler
      for convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s the first thing a person usually does when he goes crazy,
      Bill—takes off all his clothes.”
    </p>
    <p>Bill gave me an incredulous look.</p>
    <p>
      “Gosh, I hope I’ll be killed ridin’ or somethin’ and not lose my mind
      first. It ain’t decent.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      The poor demented creature would not speak nor pay any attention to the
      other men, but when he saw Steve he smiled as he asked:
    </p>
    <p>“You’ve come to take me away from them, haven’t you?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Steve said. “Will you go with me now?”</p>
    <p>La Monte stood up.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, if you won’t let them get me; those witches want to drag me back to
      hell, but I’ve fooled them this time. I’ve almost caught up with him once
      or twice and they drag me back.” And he walked off quietly by Steve’s
      side.

      Steve took him to the bunkhouse, gave him some coffee and made him lie
      down on his bed. While Steve sat beside him La Monte slept fitfully, but
      at the slightest move started and tried to get up. Steve fell in with all
      his vagaries; he promised to help him escape the witches and to help him
      find the person for whom he seemed to be searching.
    </p>
    <p>“Where was he last?” Steve asked, hoping to find some clue.</p>
    <p>
      “Why, on his horse.” La Monte sat up and stared wildly into Steve’s eyes.
      “Don’t you know, he’s always on a horse, a big black horse. He’s there
      just ahead of me, he’s always just ahead of me,” and he jumped up and
      started toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve calmed him again and he fell back on the pillows and lay there in
      silence, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      Six crestfallen cow-punchers returned from the La Monte place. No one knew
      when the man had left the camp, no one had even caught a glimpse of him.
      His clothes they had found in the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff and his posse came at last. Steve kept his hand on the arm of
      La Monte as they approached the wagon. It was a tense moment; we were all
      watching but hidden, fearful lest some trifle would arouse the demon of
      violence. The men were all armed.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Monte put his foot up on the step of the wagon, then took it off, shook
      his head, turned and walked toward the granary. We held our breath. Steve
      alone followed him.
    </p>
    <p>“Come on; you’re going with me, aren’t you?”</p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. With his eyes fixed on the ground La Monte ignored
      Steve completely. Suddenly he stopped and picked up something, the little
      cotton-wood switch to which the leaves still clung. Holding it tightly, he
      walked back to the wagon, got in, Steve by his side, and they drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were scarcely out of sight when Charley came dashing up with sixty
      dollars in gold which he had found under a pile of mud at the La Monte
      place. Owen sent him to overtake the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this yours?” Charley asked, as he rode up to them, holding the money
      out toward La Monte, who only shook his head and looked off across the
      prairie. Charley turned the money over to Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the town, La Monte seemed to become confused and
      suspicious. He would not speak. He was judged insane and committed to the
      asylum. Still in charge of the Sheriff, Steve and two other men, he was
      put on the train.
    </p>
    <p>“Where did you get him?” the conductor asked the Sheriff.</p>
    <p>“Up in the country, at the A L ranch.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, yes, I know that place; it used to be the old Bohm——”</p>
    <p>
      He never finished his sentence, for La Monte, with a cry, sprang to his
      feet, looked wildly about, brushed them aside and jumped through the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was stopped, and they ran back to where he had fallen. He had
      broken his leg, but in spite of that fought them off with superhuman
      strength. With the help of the train crew, he was overpowered at last,
      bound and taken back to the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steve told us later it was the most terrible experience he had ever been
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I just couldn’t stand the look in his eyes when they got him to the
      asylum. He didn’t say nothin’, just kept moanin’ all the time. He’d been
      there for five years, and no one knew how he got away. I suppose it would
      a come anyhow, but it seemed like it was the mention of Bohm’s name that
      set him off.”
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch10">X—AROUND THE CHRISTMAS FIRE</h2>
    <p>
      Within a radius of many miles there were only three small children, and
      about them our Christmas festivities revolved. They furnished the excuse
      for the tree, but no work was too pressing, no snow too deep to prevent
      the boys from bringing the Christmas tree and greens from a small clump of
      pines which stood on top of a distant hill, like a dark green island in
      the midst of the prairie sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on Christmas morning Steve started out with gaily bedecked baskets
      for the Mexicans, and at the ranch the greatest excitement prevailed. I
      dashed frantically between the bunkhouse and our kitchen to be certain
      that nothing was forgotten. The big turkeys were stuffed to the point of
      bursting, all the “trimmings” were in readiness, and the last savory mince
      pies were in the ovens.
    </p>

        <p>BUCKING HORSE AND RIDER</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Behind the closed doors of the living room the tall tree, festooned with
      ropes of popcorn and garlands of gaudy paper chains, glittered and glowed
      with its tinsel ornaments and candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen divided his attention between his “Santa Claus” costume and pails of
      water, which he placed near the tree in case it should catch fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys spent most of the morning “slicking up” and put on their red
      neckties, the outward and visible sign of some important event, then
      passed the remaining hours sitting around anxiously awaiting the arrival
      of the guests of honor and—dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes members of the family were with us or some friends were lured
      from the city by the promise of a “really, truly Christmas,” and there
      were always a few lonely bachelors to whom the holidays, otherwise, would
      have brought only memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas was our one great annual celebration, a day of cheer and
      happiness, in which everyone joyously shared. It was a new experience in
      the life of the undomesticated cow-puncher, but he took as much
      satisfaction in the fact that “Our tree was a whole lot prettier than the
      one I’ve saw in town” as though he had won a roping contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each year the children and their parents were invited for Christmas
      dinner. They might be delayed en route by deep snowdrifts, out of which
      they had to dig themselves, but they always arrived eventually. We came to
      have a sincere affection for those children, gentle little wild flowers of
      the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very sweet, perfectly ingenuous, gazing in round-eyed wonder
      upon things which to most of us were commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never thought of its being anything new in their brief experience until
      at dinner one of the small boys turned to his mother after tasting a piece
      of celery and said, “Look, Mamma, ’tain’t cabbage and ’tain’t onions. What
      is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      They positively trembled with excitement as they learned to read and
      laboriously spelled out the words in the simple books we gave them. They
      craved knowledge as a starving man craves bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Santa Claus, Owen wore a ruddy mask with a long white beard and
      bristling eyebrows, a fur cap pulled down over his ears, heavy felt boots
      and his long fur overcoat. He looked and acted the part so perfectly the
      children for years insisted that “there is a Santa Claus ’cause we’ve seen
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Christmas everyone was gathered about the tree waiting for this
      mysterious personage to appear when Owen suddenly thought of bells; he
      must have sleigh-bells. No self-respecting Santa Claus was complete
      without them. I was in despair; there wasn’t a sleigh-bell within a
      hundred miles, but Owen insisted that he must jingle. At last after a
      great deal of argument and searching for something which would give forth
      bell-like sounds, he finally pranced out before the spell-bound audience
      with my silver table bell sewed to the top of one of his boots. He had to
      prance because the bell refused to tinkle unless it was shaken, and for
      the ensuing hour he pranced so vigorously that between the exercise and
      the fur coat he nearly perished from heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner we all assembled in the big living-room, where my disguised
      husband presented each person with some little gift and ridiculous toy,
      accompanied by a still more ridiculous rhyme, over which the boys roared.
      They enjoyed the jokes most of all. No one escaped; Owen and I came in for
      our share with the rest. Mine usually bore veiled or open allusion to my
      particular pet lamb which had developed strong butting proclivities. He
      butted friend and foe indiscriminately, so that even my fond eyes were not
      blinded to his faults, and Owen’s remarks were most uncomplimentary after
      he had acted as a shield for us when “Jackie” had chased my sister and me
      all about the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the afternoon everybody scattered—our house guests amused
      themselves as they chose, riding, driving or hunting coyotes, the boys
      rode over to the neighboring ranches or went to “town,” the store and
      saloon at the railroad station sixteen miles away, but I spent an hour or
      two playing with the children or reading to them until their father
      “brought the team around,” their happy mother climbed up on the high seat
      of the lumber-wagon and, clinging to dolls, trains and toys, three
      blissfully happy but perfectly exhausted little children were wrapped up
      in quilts and coats, stowed into the back of the wagon and started on the
      twenty-mile drive “back home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been an eventful day in their short, barren lives, but for us it
      was the best part of Christmas, except the evening, when we all gathered
      about the big fireplace which drew everyone into its circle like a magnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing prosaic about those who grouped themselves around the
      great stone fireplaces on the ranches in the old days. Here again were
      found those contrasts, so striking and unexpected; university men who had
      come West for adventure or investment, men of wealth whose predisposition
      to weak lungs had sent them in exile to the wilderness, modest young
      Englishmen, those younger sons so often found in the most out-of-the-way
      corners of the earth, and who, through the sudden demise of a near
      relative, had such a startling way of becoming earls and lords over night;
      adventurous Scotchmen, brilliant young Irishmen, all smoking contentedly
      there in the firelight and discussing the “isms” and “ologies” and every
      other subject under heaven. But most interesting of all were their own
      reminiscences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all sitting around the fire one Christmas night when the
      conversation turned on adventure, and everyone promised to tell the most
      thrilling experience he had ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the men were lying on the big bearskin before the fire. One, a
      mining engineer, told of having been captured by bandits and held for a
      ransom, in some remote corner of Mexico where he had gone to examine a
      very famous mine. The other, a surveyor for the Union Pacific Railroad,
      had been lost during a storm and, becoming snow-blind, crawled for five
      miles on his hands and knees, feeling the trail with naked, half frozen
      hands until he reached the creek down which he waded until he came to the
      camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a big chair, the firelight playing over her slender figure, sat Janet
      Courtland, an Eastern woman, who as a mere girl had come West with her
      young husband and had gone up into Montana where he had bought a large
      cattle ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come on, Mrs. Courtland, you’re next,” the Surveyor said as he finished
      his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” Janet began, “Will and I have had so many experiences I scarcely
      know which was the most exciting, but I think our encounter with the
      Indians was the most thrilling from first to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will had to go into Miles City on business and I went with him for great
      unrest had been reported among the Indians and he didn’t want to leave me
      on the ranch alone. We had been in town only a few days when we heard that
      they were on the war path and Will felt he must go back to the ranch. He
      wanted me to stay in town, but I wouldn’t. If he was going back I was
      going with him, so we started in the buck-board on that long eighty-five
      mile drive. I’ll never forget it. The day was fearfully hot and we were
      constantly looking out for Indians. We had gone about half-way, when we
      came over the top of a hill and saw a band of Indians just below us. They
      saw us before we could turn back, we had to go on, and as we came towards
      them they formed into two lines so that we had to drive between them. It
      was horrible.” And Janet gave a shiver at the recollection. “I’ll never
      forget as long as I live those frightful, painted faces. Not an Indian
      moved; we passed through the line and had gone a short distance beyond,
      when we heard the report of a gun. Will clapped his hand to his side and
      said: ‘My God, I’m shot. Drive as fast as you can’—and he threw the lines
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I lashed the horses and we fairly tore. Everything was still, there was
      only that one shot, the Indians made no attempt to follow us. We did not
      speak. Will was lying back in the buckboard, his hand pressed to his side.
      When we had gone out of sight of the Indians I stopped the horses and
      asked Will where he was struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘In the side; I can feel the blood oozing through my fingers,’ he said.
      He took his hand away and gave an exclamation as he looked at it. It was
      wet but not with blood. We could not find the sign of a wound. We got out
      to investigate and discovered—that just as we passed the Indians the cork
      flew out of a bottle of root beer we had in the back of the buckboard and
      struck him in the side. Poor old Willie, no wonder he thought he was
      shot,” and Janet smiled at her husband, who laughed with the rest of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, Owen,” he said, “I know some of the things you’ve been through, so
      you can’t beg off,” and Owen began his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the spring of ’81 I came West to visit my brother, Ed., on his ranch
      in Wyoming. I was a tenderfoot, never having been on the plains before—and
      yet—I had scarcely arrived when I announced that the one thing I wanted to
      do was to kill a buffalo. He told me that if my heart was set on it I
      should have the chance, but that it was dangerous sport even for
      experienced hunters, as a buffalo frequently turns and gores the horse
      before it can get out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The very next day the dead body of a professional hunter was brought to
      the ranch. He had wounded a buffalo bull which had turned, caught with his
      horn the horse he was riding, thrown him to the ground and gored the
      hunter to death. The sight of his mangled body was shocking and made a
      terrible impression on my mind, but my purpose was not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My brother assigned Al. Turpin the responsibility of serving as my guide.
      He was one of the best riders on the ranch, cool-headed and a good shot.
      We took breakfast before daylight in order to get an early start. After
      riding a considerable distance three dark objects were discovered far away
      on a hill which sloped toward us. A pair of field glasses confirmed the
      opinion that they were buffalo lying down. We rode in their direction and
      kept out of sight, except as we peered cautiously over the top of each
      succeeding ridge until it was possible to approach no nearer in
      concealment, when we rode to the top of the nearest hill and were in full
      view. The buffalo saw us and quick as lightning were on their feet running
      away. We sent our horses at full speed down the slope, across a level
      piece of ground and up the hill after them. We were gaining rapidly. My
      horse was the faster of the two and was in the lead. He was one of the
      best trained cow ponies I have ever ridden and was my brother’s favorite
      for cutting out cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When about thirty yards behind the buffalo, one stopped. The bit I was
      using was severe. I pulled and threw my horse back on his haunches. The
      buffalo was an immense bull. He appeared to me as big as a mountain. He
      turned facing me, his body at an angle, cocked his head on the side, then
      threw it toward the ground and, quicker than a flash, came down the hill
      like a landslide.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My horse struggled against the bit and tried to jump toward the buffalo
      and turn him as he would a steer. I tried to swing his head away and dug
      my spurs into his sides to make him move, but he did not understand why he
      should run from a buffalo. He did respond a little and turned so that his
      haunches were toward the great brute coming down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The head of the buffalo was in striking distance. He looked like a great
      devil. His beadlike eyes flashed fire. The next instant I expected the
      horse to be pitched down the hill. I could feel myself thrown into the air
      and then gored to death when I struck the ground. I could see the mangled
      body of the dead hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “While my six-shooter was a powerful gun, I knew that if I should shoot
      the brute in the head, the ball would not go through the mass of matted
      hair and the thick skull. Still there was nothing else to do. I thought my
      time had come. In order to hit him at all it was necessary to shoot over
      my left arm. In my haste I pulled the trigger too soon. The loud report
      startled the horse into a run and turned the buffalo. Its discharge, so
      near my head, gave me a terrible shock. I thought the shot had blown away
      all the right side of my head and I put up my hand to keep my brains from
      falling out, but there were neither brains nor blood on my hand. The
      bullet had just grazed my head and gone through the rim of my hat. That
      brute looked like an infuriated demon. I couldn’t have been more
      frightened if I had met the devil himself at the mouth of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When it was all over, I was not in a mood for challenging him again, but
      as he loped away, Al. ran his horse abreast and from a safe distance put a
      shot into his brisket. He fell dead. Believe me, I have had many close
      calls, but that was the one time in all my life when I was really scared.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What extraordinary experiences people do have in this country,” Will
      Mason exclaimed, as he leaned forward to light a fresh cigar. “Speaking of
      Ed. reminds me of a strange coincidence which happened the year after he
      came West.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We had been together the year before in New York, where we had met a chap
      named Courtney Drake. He was a Yale man and a member of the University
      Club, so we saw quite a good deal of him. He was very congenial and one of
      the most lovable fellows I ever knew. He was married but he seldom spoke
      of his wife and we never met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One morning we picked up the paper and were horrified to read that Mrs.
      Courtney Drake had shot her maid. There it was in glaring headlines, the
      whole wretched affair. The Drakes were one of the oldest and wealthiest
      families in New York and it was spicy reading for the scandal lovers I
      assure you.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems that Drake had gotten mixed up with this woman when he first
      came out of college and in order to force him to marry her she told him
      that she was soon to have a child. He wouldn’t believe it, and how she
      worked it I don’t know. She must have been mighty clever, for she and her
      maid got hold of a baby somewhere and she made Courtney believe it was
      hers and that he was the father—so he married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They had only been married a short time when the maid began to demand
      large sums of ‘hush money’ and Mrs. Drake gave her whatever she asked, for
      she was in mortal dread of having Drake discover the truth. The girl found
      blackmail so profitable she became more and more insistent in her demands
      and nearly drove Mrs. Drake wild. At last she could endure it no longer
      and in a perfect frenzy, shot and killed the maid and then the whole thing
      came out. Mrs. Drake was sent to prison, where she died later, but
      Courtney vanished utterly after the trial—no one knew what became of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The next fall Ed. and I came West and two years later were up in the
      Jackson’s Hole country with a party, shooting. Ed. and one of the guides
      went out one morning to get some ducks, but in a short time they came back
      to camp carrying the dead body of Courtney Drake. They had come across his
      body on the shore of a small lake, lying face down in the mud. There was a
      single bullet hole in the back of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Think of his having been found out there in the wilderness by the only
      man in the country who knew who he was! Talk about chance,” Will sighed,
      “Poor devil, he was living out there under an assumed name. His family had
      no idea where he was. Ed. notified them and then took his body East.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just after his death Drake’s partner produced a bill of sale for the
      entire ranch and took possession of it. Everyone suspected him of the
      murder, but it couldn’t be proved. About three years later the man killed
      his wife and at the time of his conviction the question of Drake’s murder
      was brought up and he confessed. Isn’t it strange the way things happen?”
      Will’s question was general. “What on earth do you suppose sent Ed. Brook
      into the Jackson’s Hole country at that one time of all others?”
    </p>
    <p>No one answered.</p>
    <p>
      “I wonder if all new countries abound in such tragic mysteries?” The
      Surveyor looked up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What tragic mysteries have you encountered, Mrs. Brook, that makes you
      speak so feelingly?”
    </p>
    <p>Just then the clock struck twelve and I got up.</p>
    <p>
      “It’s too late for more mysteries, it’s time to go to bed—and we don’t
      want tragedies to keep us wide awake on Christmas night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, come on Esther, tell us your most thrilling experience,” they begged.
      “We won’t move a step until you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Marrying Owen,” I replied, looking over at my unsuspecting husband, “I’ve
      never had a chance to get my breath since.”
    </p>
    <p>And amid a shout of laughter the Christmas party broke up.</p>
    <h2 id="ch11">XI—TED</h2>
    <p>
      Ted landed in our midst with all the attendant violence of a meteor. He
      didn’t arrive, he landed, bag and baggage, and until his departure weeks
      later our tranquil existence was sufficiently hectic to suit even Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      After numerous letters from his doting aunt, we reluctantly consented to
      look after Ted while she was in Europe recuperating from a nervous
      break-down. At the end of the first week, we understood why Aunt Elizabeth
      found recuperation necessary, and I suggested to Owen, it might be well to
      engage our passage on a later steamer, for I had a premonition that my own
      nerves might require a rest after two months of Ted’s strenuous
      companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn’t bad; there was not a bad thing about him. He was just
      overflowing with youth and energy, which had been pent up for years,
      between boarding school in the winter and Newport in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motherless, fatherless, rich, neglected or over-indulged by a none too
      wise aunt, Ted was an appealing young person, a character easily to be
      made or marred by circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked like a member of the celestial choir—blue-eyed, fair-haired and
      mild—but he produced the effect of a Kansas cyclone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing he did not see, there was nothing he did not hear and
      there was nothing he did not do. Even on eighty thousand acres of land his
      activities were somewhat limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wildly enthusiastic about the West, fascinated by the men, and was
      Bill’s shadow, so we promptly turned him over to those “rough persons”
      Aunt Elizabeth had especially hoped that he might avoid, to get it all out
      of his system.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let him stay at the bunk-house,” Owen advised after Ted had besought me
      to allow him to stay with the men. “It will do him more good than anything
      else in the world, if he has the right stuff in him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted stood on the porch, uneasily shifting from one foot to the other, when
      I came out of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right, Ted, Mr. Brook and I are perfectly willing for you to stay
      with the men, if you really want to.”
    </p>
    <p>He hopped up and down and almost embraced me in his joy.</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, thank you, Mrs. Brook. You see,” he explained, carefully, “I’ve seen
      people like you and Mr. Brook all my life, but I never had the chance to
      be with real cow-punchers before.” Evidently, from Ted’s point of view,
      Owen and I were very commonplace individuals compared to these heroes of
      the prairie, and I laughed to myself as he bounded down the steps to break
      the joyful news to Bill that he was to share his bed and board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day we had to go to town to meet some prospective wool buyers,
      and, after having his breakfast interrupted five different times by Ted’s
      dashing in to see if we were ready, Owen was moved to inquire finally,
      “What on earth is on the boy’s mind now?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “His outfit,” I answered. “He’s been planning it for days; wishes to
      select it himself and we are not to see it until we get home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a wise stipulation of Ted’s, for if we had seen it, we should
      never have been able to get home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it on as soon as we reached the ranch, and when he finally emerged,
      the flaming sunset paled with chagrin at its futile effort of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “outfit” consisted of tan corduroy trousers, chaps of long silky
      angora wool, which had been dyed a brilliant orange, a shirt of vivid
      green, a bright red silk handkerchief for his neck, an enormous Stetson
      hat, high-heeled tan boots, silver studded belt and huge spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gasped when we saw him, but he was so intent on showing himself to
      Bill, as to be utterly unconscious of the effect he produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      We followed him into the yard where the boys were waiting the call to
      supper. Bill looked up from the quirt he was braiding and blinked.
    </p>
    <p>“Gosh! I thought the sun had set an hour ago,” he remarked.</p>
    <p>
      “No,” Ted laughingly responded, giving him a push, “but he’s going to
      ‘set’ now,” and he threw himself down by Bill’s side. “I knew you fellows
      would guy me, but all the same I think this outfit’s great,” and he
      surveyed himself with infinite pride and satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s all right,” said Bill, taking in all the details of the resplendent
      costume, and looking up at Owen and me with twinkling eyes, “I like
      somethin’ a little gay myself; but round here where everything’s green, we
      won’t be able to tell you from a bunch of soap-weed,” and Ted good
      naturedly joined in the laugh at his own expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wouldn’t his Aunt Elizabeth die of heart-failure if she could see him
      now?” I asked Owen as we went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She certainly would,” he answered, “but we’ll trust to luck and let
      Nature take its course.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything, including Nature, took its course rapidly with Ted, and for
      the next few weeks wise prairie dogs, rabbits and rattle-snakes stayed in
      their holes. By the end of his stay that energetic young person had enough
      rattle-snake skins to provide belts and hat-bands for all of New York, and
      scores of live prairie-dogs he had trapped to be shipped to his aunt’s
      place in Newport.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to picture the joy of Aunt Elizabeth and her neighbors when they
      found informal prairie-dog towns in the midst of their formal gardens. If
      life is measured by experiences, a few additional years were in store for
      Newport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill taught Ted to shoot and he spent hours and a fortune shooting at old
      tin cans on a post before Bill finally consented to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve saw fellers do worse,” the sweetest praise that ever fell on mortal
      ears, judging by Ted’s expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, then, Owen went to New Mexico to buy some sheep and Bohm came to
      sleep on a claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      This claim was one over which Owen and Bohm had been having a controversy
      for months. It had been included in the sale of the ranch, and after one
      of our most important sheep camps had been built upon it, Owen discovered
      that Bohm could not give a deed to it, as he had not made final proof on
      the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bohm never ceased to regret having sold the ranch, and had never forgiven
      Owen for buying it and making him live up to his contract, so was only too
      glad of the opportunity to cause him all the trouble possible. Time after
      time he promised to come out and “prove up”, but he never came, so
      although I was most anxious to have him come, I was far from pleased to
      have him about when Owen was away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted, however, was overjoyed; he seemed to feel that Providence had
      arranged Bohm’s visit to the ranch for his especial entertainment, and
      from the moment the old chap arrived Ted dogged his footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, old Bohm seemed quite flattered and laughed and joked with him,
      praised his shooting, told him stories of the Indian days, promised to
      show him the underground passage to an abandoned stage station, but later
      he became annoyed, for no clinging burr ever clung more closely than Ted.
      He scarcely allowed Bohm to get out of his sight for one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much the boy had heard of old Bohm’s history I did not know, but I
      concluded a few rumors had reached those ever-attentive ears, for one day
      he came in fairly beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gosh! Pudge and Soapy haven’t got anything on me, they’ve only seen
      Buffalo Bill in a show, and I’m right in the same house with a man that’s
      a holy terror!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean, Ted?” I asked, anxious to find out how much he had
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, you know well enough, Mrs. Brook,” he laughed, going to the door as
      he saw old Bohm on his way to the barn. “You can’t fool me. Gee! I
      wouldn’t have missed him for the world. The fellows’ll just be sick when I
      tell them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fellows” were evidently “Pudge” and “Soapy”, his two chums at St.
      Paul’s, “Pudge” because of “his shape,” as Ted explained, and “Soapy”,
      whose parental millions came from the manufacturing of soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game between the boy and Bohm was amusing. Clever as the old chap was,
      he couldn’t evade Ted’s watchful eye. If Bohm thought him miles away, he
      suddenly appeared with such an unconscious air of innocence he disarmed
      all suspicion, but he made Bohm uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quit campin’ on the old man’s trail, Kid,” said Bill one evening at the
      corral after Ted had driven Bohm to the bunk-house to escape his
      questions. “You’re gettin’ on his nerves; let him go and sleep on his
      claim and get through with it. You and me’s got to hunt horses tomorrow,
      anyways.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted cheerfully acquiesced, and old Bohm loaded his wagon alone and drove
      toward his claim in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning very early, I heard Bill calling Ted. No Ted appeared,
      and I went out to see where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where do you reckon that crazy kid’s went now?” demanded Bill, impatient
      to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m sure I don’t know, Bill, hunting prairie-dogs, probably. Don’t wait
      for him, if you’re ready to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Huntin’ prairie-dogs,” echoed Bill. “I’ll bet a hat he’s huntin’ old Bohm
      somewheres.” He frowned as he cinched up his saddle. “I reckon I’d better
      ride over that way and see what he’s up to.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wish you would,” I said, vaguely uneasy. “I don’t want him to bother
      Bohm too much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Me neither,” said Bill, getting on his horse, “there’s his pony’s tracks
      now,” he looked at the ground. “I’ll find him and take him along with me.
      Don’t you worry, he’s all right, but he sure is a corker—that kid,” and
      Bill galloped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt confident that he would overtake the lad, so I dismissed them all
      from my mind and settled down to an uninterrupted morning, and a delayed
      postal report.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was busy all day and was just starting out for a little walk before
      supper when Bill and Ted rode up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill and Ted, hatless, clothes torn and covered with dirt and blood, their
      faces scratched and bruised, and Ted regarding me triumphantly from one
      half-closed eye, the other being swollen shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What on earth hap—” I tried to ask, my breath fairly taken away. Bill got
      off his horse and came up to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’re all right, Mrs. Brook. I’m sorry you seen us ’fore we got fixed up
      a little; we just got mixed up some with Bohm—that’s all—’taint nothin’
      serious. We look a whole lot worse than we feel, don’t we Ted?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You bet we do,” mumbled Ted from a cut and bleeding mouth, “but you ought
      to see Bohm, he’s a sight!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted got off his horse with difficulty. “Gosh, it was great,” he said,
      leaning up against the fence for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in and sit down, both of you, Charley will take your horses,” and I
      led the way into the house followed a little unsteadily by Bill and Ted,
      who collapsed on the first chairs they could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave them some wine, washed off their blood-stained faces, and made
      protesting Ted go into my room and lie down. He was very pale, and I saw
      that he was faint.
    </p>
    <p>I came back into the kitchen.</p>
    <p>“Now, Bill, tell me about it. What happened and where is Bohm?”</p>
    <p>
      “On his way back to Denver in the baggage car,” announced Bill, draining
      the last drop from the glass he still held in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>I started, “Oh, Bill, you didn’t kill him?”</p>
    <p>
      “No, but I wisht I had,” he said calmly. “He’d oughter be dead, the old
      skunk, trying to poison all them sheep.”
    </p>
    <p>“Poison the sheep; what sheep?”</p>
    <p>
      “Your sheep,” Bill’s brows contracted as he looked at me. “Your sheep,” he
      repeated, his voice rising as I scarcely seemed able to grasp his meaning.
      “All the sheep at Hay Gulch Camp, that’s what he came out here for, and
      he’d a done it, too, if it hadn’t been for that kid in there.” Bill jerked
      his head in the direction of my room.
    </p>
    <p>“Ted?” I asked, my emotion stifling my voice.</p>
    <p>
      “Ted,” Bill affirmed, “he caught him at it red-handed, and probably saved
      two thousand sheep from bein’ dead this minute.”
    </p>
    <p>“How on earth did he find out?”</p>
    <p>Bill straightened up in his chair.</p>
    <p>
      “Them eyes of his’n don’t miss much, I’m here to tell you, and his
      everlastin’ snoopin’ around done some good after all.” Bill’s eyes glowed
      with pride. “Yesterday, before Bohm left, Ted come across him mixin’ a lot
      of stuff with some grain, and, of course, had to know all about it. The
      old man finally told him he was fixin’ to poison the prairie-dogs on his
      claim, bit he was so peevish about it, Ted said he didn’t believe him, and
      mistrusted somethin’ was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The kid didn’t say nothin’ to me about it; had some fool notion about
      playin’ detective, I reckon, at any rate he got up along about four
      o’clock and rode out to Bohm’s claim to do a little reconorterin’.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill reluctantly put the glass down and tipped back in his chair. “He hid
      his horse in the gulch and crope up in the grass like an Injin. The herder
      wasn’t nowhere in sight and the sheep was still in the corral, but old
      Bohm was there all right, fixin’ little piles of that poisoned wheat just
      where the sheep would come acrost it the first thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Bill, that’s the worst thing I ever heard!” I was sick at the mere
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>Bill was too engrossed to pay attention to the interruption.</p>
    <p>
      “Ted said he was comin’ back to tell me, but he got so excited when he
      seen what Bohm was up to, he never thought of nothin’ but stoppin’ him.
      The old man was stoopin’ over with his back to Ted, and the kid gave a
      yell for the herder and ran for Bohm and before he could straighten up Ted
      was on top of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill scarcely paused for breath—“the old man reached for his gun, but Ted
      was too quick for him and knocked it out of his hand, and when I came up,
      there they was rollin’ all over the prairie, first one on top and then the
      other.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill looked toward the door of my room, reflectively—“I kinder felt there
      was somethin’ wrong when I left here, and believe me, I didn’t spare my
      cayuse none gettin’ there neither, and I didn’t get there none too soon.”
    </p>
    <p>I was incapable of speech. I just stared at Bill.</p>
    <p>
      “There ain’t no doubt about Bohm’s bein’ ready to kill him; he was on top
      then and reachin’ for his throat. I didn’t stop to ask no questions. I
      jest grabbed him, and pulled him off of Ted. He was white as chalk and
      ready to eat us both alive, but I hung on to him while Ted got up cryin’,
      ‘Look what he’s done, Bill, look what he’s done,’ and pointed at somethin’
      on the ground.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill’s eyes were like two live coals. “Bohm was cussin’ like a steam
      engine ’bout the kid’s jumpin’ him when he was puttin’ out poison for the
      prairie-dogs. I just took one look around and seen all them piles of
      poison wheat there by the corral when there wasn’t a prairie-dog within
      two miles. I—well, I aint goin’ to tell you what I said, Mrs. Brook,
      ’taint fit for you to hear.”
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Bill looked down and turned the glass on the table around and around. He
      looked up again and smiled, but his brows contracted as he went on—“We had
      words then, sure enough. All of a sudden Bohm made a lunge and caught the
      handkerchief round my neck with one hand and reached for somethin’ with
      the other, and the first thing I knew he was slashin’ at me with a pocket
      knife. I guess I saw red then, ’cause I knocked him down and nearly
      pounded the life out of him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill stopped a moment—“His eyes was rollin’ back in his head and his
      tongue was hangin’ out and there was a pool of blood ’round us, three
      yards across.” Bill’s description was so vivid I shut my eyes. “I reckon
      I’d killed him if Ted hadn’t tromped my legs and kinda brought me to
      myself. He’d oughter been killed, but I let him up then and told Ted to go
      for my rope. We tied his hands and legs. I guess he had about all he
      wanted for he wasn’t strugglin’ much.” Bill smiled grimly. “We carried him
      into the cabin, and there was the Mexican lying in his bunk—doped. We knew
      who done it all right, and I tell you we didn’t handle Bohm like no
      suckin’ infant when we laid him down, neither.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill’s face was stern and set and I shared his indignation too much to
      trust myself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We left him there and went to get the wheat out of the way before we
      opened the corral gates for the sheep. Thanks to Ted, Bohm hadn’t had time
      to put much around. He’s a great little kid, that boy.” Bill’s voice
      broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bless his heart,” I said, my own heart filled with gratitude and
      tenderness for the plucky little chap in the other room. Bill’s eyes were
      moist, but his voice was steady again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Steve and Charley came up just then with the supply wagon, so Steve set
      Charley to herd the sheep. We loaded Bohm into the wagon and Steve took
      him over to the railroad. He said he’d see he got on the train all right.”
      Bill grinned, “You’re rid of Bohm for good now, Mrs. Brook, for I kinda
      think he gathered from what me and Steve said the ranch wouldn’t be no
      health resort for him if he ever showed his ugly face round here again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Bill, I’m so thankful; it makes me sick when I think what might have
      happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t thank me, Mrs. Brook, I ain’t done nothin’.” Bill’s face was red
      with embarrassment as he stood up. “Ted’s the one to thank, he’s some kid,
      believe me,” and Bill’s eyes were very tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go in and see how he’s making it.” Bill followed me into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted was sitting up on the couch, regarding his battered visage in my
      hand-glass with the greatest interest. I could see at once he was in no
      mood for emotion or petting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hello, I’m all right,” he murmured with a one-sided grin. “Say, Bill,
      wasn’t it great? I wouldn’t have missed it for a million dollars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank back with a sigh of supreme satisfaction. “I just wish I could
      remember all the things he called me. I want to spring them on the fellows
      when I go back.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill looked at him with genuine concern. “See here, kid,” he said
      decidedly, “you want to forget all them things as quick as you can. Don’t
      you go springin’ any such language back where you come from. I’m no
      innocent babe myself, but I’m here to tell you old Bohm’s cussin’ made
      anything I ever heard sound like a Sunday School piece. You forget it now,
      pronto,” he commanded as he went out of the door. “It’s a reflection on me
      and Mrs. Brook.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After Bill had gone, Ted looked at himself again, then at me. “What do you
      suppose Aunt Elizabeth would say if she could see me now?” We both
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would be a ‘disgrace to my family and position’ now, sure enough.” He
      felt his blackened eye tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down on the couch beside him. “You will never be more of a credit to
      your family than you are at this minute, Ted, nor more of a man.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, for my voice shook a little. He knew what I meant and his
      lips twitched as he patted my hand gently, and turned his face away.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ch12">XII—BLIZZARDS</h2>
    <p>
      It was just like Louise Reynolds to arrive on the wings of a blizzard,
      wearing a straw hat and spring suit. Louise led the seasons, she never
      followed them, and she preceded that particular storm by about two hours;
      but she was justified, for it was April and she was on her way from
      California.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this land of the unexpected even the weather disregarded all
      established precedents. A glorious Indian Summer night extended into
      January, or a sudden blizzard would swoop down from the North in October
      or April and leave us snowed in for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is exactly what happened upon this occasion and most of Louise’s
      visit was spent in shovelling snow for the pure joy of the exercise. That
      energetic young person had to do something in lieu of tennis or golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prairies were covered with a fluffy mantle of purest white, great
      drifts filled the gulches and the roads were utterly obliterated. Long
      after the storm the men had to go about on horseback for no wagon could be
      moved through the deep snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Louise announced that she had all of her reservations
      through to Baltimore, where she was to officiate as bridesmaid. She was
      obliged to go and we had to take her to the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could scarcely go on horseback with baggage, there wasn’t a sleigh in
      the country, certainly none on the ranch, but if Necessity was the Mother
      of Invention, Owen was a near relative. He never failed to find some way
      of meeting the most difficult problem. If Louise must go it devolved upon
      him to see that she reached the station and so he produced a sled, a
      disreputable old affair, used for the exalted purpose of hauling dead
      animals to “the dump”—but still it was a sled and under Owen’s direction
      it was scrubbed and transformed into the most luxurious equipage by having
      a packing box nailed on the back and covered with rugs. Louise and I
      perched on the box, with heavy robes tucked in about us, the suit cases
      were at our feet and Owen sat on the trunk in front to drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one draw-back, the sled had no tongue to keep it from
      running on to the heels of the horses, so Owen cut a hole in the bottom of
      the sled through which he stuck a broom-stick. My task was to work this
      improvised brake when we went down hill by jabbing the broom-stick into
      the snow. It worked beautifully except that the friction against the hard
      snow broke pieces of it off and it grew perceptibly shorter as we
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to avoid some especially deep gulches we left the valley and
      followed a high ridge. It was much longer, but we had allowed the entire
      day for the trip. There was no danger of becoming lost as long as we could
      see, for we knew too well the country and the general direction to be
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No incident marred the joy of that day. When the horses floundered and
      almost disappeared from sight in a snow-filled gulch, leaving the sled
      stranded like an Ark on a gleaming Ararat, we had only to dig the horses
      out with a shovel which had been taken for the purpose and after getting
      them on the level ground, go back and hitch a long rope to the sled, draw
      it across the gulch and proceed upon our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the sun upon the snow was so intense it was necessary to wear
      colored glasses to avoid snow blindness, and being muffled in furs, we
      looked like three bears in goggles. Our wraps kept us perfectly warm and
      it was a merry ride. The adventure filled us with joy as we glided over
      the trackless world in which we alone moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no suggestion of dreariness or desolation in the scene. Under
      the magic touch of the sun the world burst forth into a miracle of glory
      and beauty which held us spellbound. The sky was cloudless, not a shadow
      fell across that dazzling white expanse, which flashed and sparkled with
      all the prismatic colors. Far to the west Pike’s Peak stood, a marvel of
      varying lights and shadows, its head resting on the soft blue bosom of the
      sky. Its commanding height had filled the Indian of the Plains with
      worshipful awe, it was to him “the Gate of Heaven, the abiding place of
      the Great Spirit.” According to his own testimony, the one inevitable duty
      in the life of the Indian is the duty of prayer—and how often as he looked
      upon that distant mountain must the red hunter have paused in the midst of
      the vast prairies, his soul uplifted and an unspoken prayer on his lips!
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole aspect of the country was changed, all the familiar landmarks
      were gone. Except for the hills, the surface of the prairie was perfectly
      level as though the Great Spirit had stretched his hand forth from that
      mystic mountain and passing it over the world had left it smooth and
      stainless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful experience, and when toward evening we reached the
      railroad we were thrilled and triumphant over our accomplishment. The
      night was spent in the little four-room “hotel,” we saw Louise safely on
      board the eastbound express the next morning, then returned to the ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be out after a blizzard is one thing, to be out in one is quite
      another, and we always grew apprehensive when the sky became suddenly
      overcast and the snow began to fall from leaden clouds. What if the storm
      should catch the herders and the sheep too far away from the camp?
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all warned to range their sheep to the North if it threatened to
      storm, as most of the blizzards came from that direction and the sheep
      would go before the wind back to camp and safety. But they will not face
      it and, if unmindful of his orders, the herder took them South and a
      sudden storm came, he could not turn his sheep back to the camp; they
      would drift on and on before the wind, sometimes plunging over a bank to
      be buried beneath the drifting snow or piling up and smothering each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter just as Owen and I were starting home from California we
      received a telegram from Steve saying that during a blizzard the buck herd
      had been lost. Owen had some very important business which detained him
      when we reached Denver, so he asked me to go on to the ranch, have Steve
      organize the men into searching parties and look through every gulch in
      the vicinity for any discolored holes on the top of the drifts which would
      be caused by the breath of the sheep if they were under the snow. For two
      days the men searched and finally came to a deep bank of snow on the top
      of which were found the discolored holes they sought; they dug down and
      discovered the bucks. A few had been smothered, but most of them were
      taken out alive after having been buried for ten days! During the storm
      the herder had left them and the poor distracted things had drifted over
      an embankment and were entombed under the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When anyone speaks of “good-for-nothing Mexicans” I think of Fidel, a mere
      lad, who had taken his sheep South on a clear morning, but was overtaken
      by a storm before he could get them back to the corrals. He and his dog
      did everything they could do to turn them, but they drifted farther and
      farther away. Fidel stayed with them, guiding them away from the gulches
      until they reached a railway cut. There Steve found them twenty-four hours
      later when we feared that Fidel had perished with his sheep. Facing death
      alone in the freezing wind and blinding, smothering snow, hour after hour
      he had kept his sheep from piling up. He not only saved them all, but they
      were in better condition than many in the corrals at the camps. Not for a
      moment had he left them. His hands and feet were frozen; he barely escaped
      freezing to death and on that day we learned the true meaning of
      “Fidelity.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      Then once more Fate took a hand in our affairs and a blizzard changed the
      whole course of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We owned our land and no one could encroach upon us, but after a few years
      we began to notice forlorn little shacks built here and there on the open
      range by the poor home-seekers who, attracted by the prospect of free
      land, had begun “homesteading.” They built flimsy little houses, scratched
      up the surface of the prairie for a few inches and raised pitiful,
      straggling crops. The settlers were coming in! The opening wedge of that
      great onrush had been thrust deep into the heart of the prairie. In the
      undisputed possession of our own land we were not disturbed. While we knew
      that it meant the occupation of the free range and the passing of the
      large ranches, eventually, we scarcely realized how soon it would come and
      were not prepared to receive an offer from an Eastern syndicate to buy the
      entire ranch—to cut it into small units to be sold as farms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The era of “dry-farming” had just begun, when by scientific methods, deep
      ploughing and the conservation of all moisture, dry land might be
      successfully cultivated without irrigation. It was a dream of the future
      of the prairie region, impossible to visualize, and I laughed in my
      ignorance, as Owen read me the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How perfectly absurd. Imagine trying to farm out here; the grangers would
      starve to death in a year unless they had stock of some sort. Surely you
      would never think of selling out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know, Esther, the homesteaders can’t come on to our deeded land,
      but they are filing on all the Government land. In a short time there will
      be no more free range, and did you ever stop to consider that our land
      will soon be so valuable that we can’t afford to run sheep on it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In that last sentence I saw the handwriting on the wall. It was only a
      question of time and this phase, too, of our life would pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the East life seems to be static, but in the West it is in a state of
      flux and conditions are constantly changing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I had inherited the static state of mind for I had taken it for
      granted that all the rest of our days were to be spent there on the ranch
      under the shadow of the mountain. Suddenly a realization of the facts
      swept over me. In a sense we had been pioneers, we had blazed a trail that
      others were to follow and like the Indians we, too, were destined to move
      on. However, before you are thirty to regard yourself as a hoary-headed
      pioneer requires a series of mental gymnastics and, while my brain was
      going through a few preparatory exercises, I did not take the question of
      selling out very seriously. After all those years of struggle just as it
      had been brought to perfection, after we had put into it the best of our
      life, youth, energy and work, a part of our very selves, it did not seem
      possible that we could part with the ranch. Owen felt much as I did, but
      he was the first to realize that we had come again to the parting of the
      ways and that a decision must be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet—in the end—it wasn’t the financial consideration nor a deep conviction
      that the future development of the country would be retarded if we
      remained, but an unexpected blizzard which turned the scale and set us
      adrift again.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      The sun rose clear on the 19th of October, but during the morning it began
      to grow cloudy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen and several of the men were at the railroad station where they were
      shipping lambs. During the afternoon the wind began to blow, it grew much
      colder and snow fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning it was storming very hard and Steve, after arranging to
      have hay hauled to the various camps, went out on horseback to see that
      all the sheep were kept in the corrals. I was greatly relieved when Owen
      got home in the middle of the afternoon. Ten thousand lambs had been
      loaded and started on their way in spite of the storm, but the drive back
      to the ranch had been very hard, for hour by hour the storm increased in
      fury. The ground was covered and even the dull grey sky was hidden by
      dense clouds of powdery snow which did not seem to fall upon the earth but
      was blown in long horizontal lines across the prairies by the force of a
      mighty gale. It filled the gulches and piled in deep drifts. It was driven
      against the house with such force it sifted through the smallest crack.
      The windows on the North and West were covered with a solid coating of
      snow, the wind whistled and moaned and tore at the shutters as if trying
      to carry them with it on a wild race over the plains. It was impossible to
      see the corrals, even the garden fence was lost behind the driving,
      swirling snow. To open the door was to inhale a freezing gust of
      snow-laden air, millions of icy particles blinded the eyes and took away
      the breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      We knew that the sheep were all in the corrals, but we feared that unless
      the herders watched them carefully they would pile up as the snow drifted
      over the high sides of the inclosure. The rest of the stock was protected
      and my heart was filled with thankfulness that Owen and the men had been
      able to reach the ranch. They went about the place like white wraiths
      doing the necessary things. Above the howling of the wind not a sound
      could be heard; a shout was carried miles away as soon as it left the
      lips. By five o’clock it was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eight o’clock, Mary came in and told Owen that Steve wanted to see
      him. When Owen returned, instead of coming into the living-room, he went
      to the closet, took down his short, fleece-lined riding coat and began to
      put it on.
    </p>
    <p>“What’s the matter, Owen, you are not going out?”</p>
    <p>
      “I must,” he said, quietly, winding a long scarf about his neck, “Steve
      says that Dorn went out yesterday afternoon with a load of hay for the
      camp on Six Shooter; he should have come back last night or certainly this
      morning. He’s new and doesn’t know the country and he may be lost. I’m
      going to see if I can find him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart stood still; the camp on Six Shooter gulch was fully eight miles
      away. Eight miles in that storm! It did not seem possible that a man could
      live to go a mile.
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, Owen, I can’t let you go! Don’t you suppose he is at the camp?”</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know, he may be, but I must go and find out. We can’t take a
      chance on a man’s being lost.” In the face of that argument there was
      nothing to say and nothing to do but accept it.
    </p>
    <p>“Who is going with you?”</p>
    <p>
      “No one”—Owen did not look at me as he answered—“I can’t ask any of the
      men to face this storm.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood; he couldn’t require any of his men to risk their lives. A
      hand of ice closed about my heart and deadened every sensibility. Like a
      machine I went about helping Owen get ready and at last went to the
      kitchen to bring him some coffee just before he left. A man was standing
      by the door muffled in wraps. I stood still.
    </p>
    <p>“Why, Bill, where have you been?”</p>
    <p>
      “I ain’t ‘been’, I’m goin’. I’m goin’ with Mr. Brook. A man ain’t got no
      business out a night like this alone.”
    </p>
    <p>“Bill!” It was all I could say—but he understood.</p>
    <p>When Owen came out he tried to dissuade him, but Bill was determined.</p>
    <p>
      “I know I don’t have to go, Mr. Brook, you never asked me, but I’m a
      goin’, there ain’t nothin’ can keep me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen him so serious, all the old half bantering tone was gone
      and they went out together, master and man, each risking his life for the
      sake of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to watch them but instantly they were lost to my sight as a vague
      grey cloud closed about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the night passed I do not know. I kept the fires up and the coffee hot
      and walked miles, back and forth, back and forth. I did not think of
      sleeping. It was useless to try to read. I could not see the words—the
      printed page was blank and I could only see the figures of two men on
      horseback, beaten, buffeted, fighting for their lives against the cruel
      snow-laden gale. I saw them separated, perhaps, trying to get through the
      gulches on their floundering horses, or walking to keep from freezing and
      then perhaps exhausted—lying down to rest while that last deadly sensation
      of sleepiness crept over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daylight came at last, but still I walked. I pushed my breakfast away
      untasted and tried to occupy myself with the duties of the day. I felt as
      though I should scream aloud if that howling wind did not cease, but hour
      after hour passed and there was no other sound. The men came and went
      about their work quietly, speaking but little and then in subdued tones as
      in the presence of death; over us all hung the pall of terrifying
      uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When occasionally it was possible to catch a glimpse of the corrals or the
      blacksmith shop I knew that the wind must be abating and time after time I
      knocked the snow from the windows and stood straining my eyes into that
      misty, vague out-of-doors. Ten o’clock, eleven o’clock. Something moved
      along the edge of the pond, the vague outlines of some animal, a slight
      lull in the wind and I could see that it was a horseman, another
      followed—I caught up a cape, flung open the door, dashed out into the
      storm through drifts, over every detaining obstacle until I reached the
      corral and—Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were safe, but so weary and worn they could scarcely speak. Their
      faces were swollen, having been whipped and lashed by the icy particles
      the wind had driven against them like bits of steel from a mighty blast
      furnace, their eyebrows and lashes were solid ice, their lips cracked and
      bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a night of horror, at three in the morning, they had found Dorn at
      the Six Shooter camp comfortably sleeping with the Mexican herder! When
      the storm began he made no attempt to come back to the ranch, not stopping
      to think that his non-appearance would cause any anxiety, besides
      endangering the lives of two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was so hot when I seen Dorn nice and warm all cuddled up there with
      that Dago I jest drug him out by the collar and shook him. Anybody that’ud
      sleep with a Mexican had orter freeze to death. Gosh! Here was Mr. Brook
      and me amblin’ over this whole blamed country, flounderin’ through snow
      drifts as high as this house, gettin’ our horses down and most freezin’ to
      death, blintin’ a no account thing like that.” Bill was himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their knowledge of the country and presence of mind had saved them, for
      once when they found that it had grown warmer and apparently the wind had
      ceased, they realized that the horses had turned with the wind so that it
      was at their backs, they forced the poor things into the face of the
      bitter gale again and went on. They passed the camp without seeing it and
      had gone beyond when the wind brought them the smell of the sheep, they
      turned back and after searching found the cabin. It was a narrow escape
      for they were too exhausted to have gone farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later we learned that old John, who had been our mail carrier,
      had perished in the storm. He had gone out to try to find his cattle and
      did not return. His wife and little son were alone and when they were able
      to get out and look for him, they found him just outside the garden fence
      lying frozen and half eaten by the coyotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought much during the following days and finally I came to a
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Owen, if you want to sell out I’m willing—it will have to come some day,
      I realize that, and besides—there is too much at stake. I don’t believe I
      can ever live through another blizzard.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      In three months all the stock on the ranch was sold, a caretaker was
      placed in charge of the home ranch, which we retained, and we moved to
      Denver. But instead of selling out to the syndicate, Owen decided to put
      our lands on the market himself and they were listed for sale.
    </p>
    <p>It was the end of the old life; we had made way for the settlers.</p>
    <h2 id="ch13">XIII—ECHOES OF THE PAST</h2>
    <p>
      The curtain of years had fallen and risen again on the same scene, the
      valley which stretched off toward the setting sun and the guardian
      mountain which stood unchanged at its head. But this was October, the
      royal season of purple and gold and red, when the asters and sunflowers
      were blooming their lives away in one lavish outpouring of beauty and the
      rose bushes were crimson under the kiss of the frost. A shimmering mass of
      gold clothed the great cotton-woods along the winding course of the creek
      and hills of russet brown replaced those of vivid green I had first seen
      sixteen years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the young bride had stood on that July day, amid the strange
      surroundings, looking with inexperienced eyes upon a new world, she stood
      again, seeing it from the angle of a participant, from the viewpoint of a
      woman, fused by the furnace of experience into a part of that life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same scene, but the setting had changed and as a flood of
      memories swept over me I felt as though I were a reincarnated spirit,
      walking the earth in a third phase of existence, having passed through the
      first, a light-hearted girl among family and friends in urban
      surroundings, having lived through the second, an atom in the midst of
      those vast wind-swept plains amongst elemental conditions, a part in the
      great primitive struggle for existence and coming back again to find the
      prairies transformed by cultivation into farms, with the crops covering
      the hills and bottom lands like a huge patch-work quilt of green, brown
      and brilliant yellow, fastened together with black threads of barbed wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above on the hill stood a church and a school-house, those certain
      indications of community life. Across the meadows great red barns and
      towering wind mills overshadowed the less pretentious houses. Bridges
      spanned the creek with its shifting, treacherous sand and in place of the
      dim winding trails across the prairie, neatly fenced county roads
      decorously followed the section lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same—yet everything was changed. This well-ordered farming
      community seemed prosaic, it lacked the romance and charm of the old ranch
      life and the glorious sense of unlimited freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bunkhouse was occupied by the family of a hard-working farmer who had
      married the daughter of our caretaker, Parker; tractors, ploughs and
      harrows filled the space about the blacksmith shop. I resented those
      unfamiliar implements and the prosperous farms. On all sides there was
      heard a strange language of silos, separators and “crop rotation”. I had
      become a part of the old life, but here I felt restricted and out of
      place—an alien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the house all, too, was changed. The books which Joe had scorned,
      the crystal clock and our Lares and Penates were in our Denver home, but
      on the ranch I missed them and most of all the old familiar faces. All had
      gone. Several of the boys had stayed in the country, married and taken up
      farming, raising bounteous crops and numerous children. Some, individual
      and picturesque to the end, had crossed the Great Divide, others had
      sought new positions in Wyoming, the last of the frontier states. Bill was
      there cooking in an oil camp. We received characteristic, though
      infrequent, letters from him, usually in the early summer, labored
      epistles over which he had “sworn and sweat,” as he expressed it, which
      began by assuring us that he was well and hoped that we were the same and
      ended by an earnest request to go with us as cook “in case you was
      thinkin’ of goin’ campin’.” He went with us when we did go, the same old
      Bill, unchanged in heart or humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bohm was dead. The final act of that great tragedy took place in an
      isolated mine where he had sunk all his fortune in a golden prospect.
      Hoping to regain it, the fortune he held in trust for a friend had
      followed, but the game he had played so successfully before failed when
      Nemesis took a hand. His friend went to the mine to demand an accounting
      and several hours later Bohm’s body, broken and bleeding, was taken from
      the depths of the mine. According to the story of his companion, the only
      witness, he had slipped and fallen to the bottom of the shaft—and his
      death, as his life, remained an enigma.
    </p>
    <p>
      But down through the long years the echoes of the past reverberated. Again
      and again we heard them, sometimes very faintly, then with perfect
      distinctness and on that day of our return after a long absence we felt
      again that mysterious suggestion of tragedy and the echoes were
      startlingly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I came in from my walk just before supper, a strange man rode up and
      Mr. Parker asked him to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told us his name and during the progress of the meal took little part
      in the conversation, but after he had eaten his supper he leaned back in
      his chair and in response to Owen’s question, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, I ain’t exactly a stranger round here, but this old kitchen is about
      the only thing that ain’t changed. I used to know every inch of ground in
      this country when I was punchin’ cows for the Three Circle outfit. This
      was the only ranch within twenty-five miles. I’ve et here lots of times.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You knew the Bohms then?” I asked, trying as always to find the answer to
      the riddle of old Bohm’s personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sure, I knew the Bohms,” the stranger replied, his clear blue eyes
      meeting mine frankly. “I knowed everybody there was in the country, there
      wasn’t many in them days, jest the Bohms, the Mortons, the Bosmans and the
      La Montes. They’re most all gone now except Bosman. I heered old La Monte
      died last winter—but Lord, he’s been worse ’en dead for most twenty years.
      Did you folks know him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Scarcely, we only saw him once,” and before me rose the picture of the
      desolate old place, the slowly opened door and that living ghost on the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>The stranger again spoke.</p>
    <p>“You folks bought from Bohm, so you knowed him, didn’t you?”</p>
    <p>“Oh, yes, we knew him.” Owen answered for my thoughts were far away.</p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir,” said the old cow-puncher, reaching for a toothpick, “Jim Bohm
      was a great one, he was the slickest man in this country. He didn’t have
      nothin’ but a little band of horses that he drove up from Texas when he
      came, but he kept gettin’ richer all the time.” I came back to the present
      with a start, his words were almost the same Mrs. Morton had used sixteen
      years before.
    </p>
    <p>“Wasn’t he honest?” I asked, wondering what the reply would be.</p>
    <p>He did not answer for a moment.</p>
    <p>
      “Well, I can’t say as to that. I jest knowed him from meetin’ him on the
      round-ups and when I stopped here. I never had no dealin’s with him, but
      he sure had a reputation for all the meanness there was, and I guess he
      deserved it. He was good company though, and Lord, how he could play the
      fiddle.” He was interrupted by a sudden clatter. Mrs. Parker had dropped
      her spoon and was looking at him as if fascinated. “I liked Mrs. Bohm, but
      I never had no use for him. I don’t know about the other things, but he
      sure done Jean La Monte dirt.” He rose from the table and walked toward
      the door. “Well, I reckon I’d better be movin’ on, I want to get to
      Bosman’s tonight.” He looked up the valley, “I can see Bohm now, ridin’
      that big black horse of his, carryin’ a little cotton-wood switch for a
      whip, and laughin’ at everything, he was a queer one, sure enough. Well,
      so long—thank you for my supper,” and he went out into the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Big black horse! He was always on a big black horse!” That pitiful
      refrain of Jean La Monte as he had sought the rider of that horse through
      all those weary years. Again I saw the men waiting in the wagon and that
      poor half-clad figure stooping to pick up a little cotton-wood switch, and
      I wondered if across the great divide La Monte had caught up with Bohm at
      last.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      Owen was busy in the office making out contracts for recently purchased
      land. Mr. Parker and an agent were entertaining some land-buyers, scraps
      of their conversation “bushels to the acre” and “back in Kansas” reached
      me from time to time as I walked up and down under the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where are you, childy?” Dear Mrs. Parker was always concerned when I was
      not in sight. “Out there alone?” she asked as she came across the yard to
      join me. We sat down on the bunk-house steps, glorying in the beauty of
      the night. We were silent for a few moments and then she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know, Mrs. Brook, him talkin’ about Mr. Bohm tonight at supper has
      made me think of so many things. I never paid much attention to all them
      stories old Mrs. Morton and other folks told, but some mighty queer things
      have happened since we’ve been here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What kind of things?” I asked, wondering if she, too, had breathed the
      air of mystery which surrounded the old ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t know exactly,” she hesitated, “you’ll think I’m silly,
      perhaps, but you know sometimes when I’m down there,” she pointed to the
      house among the trees, “makin’ out my postal reports, sometimes it’s
      eleven or twelve o’clock before I’m through. It’s awful quiet after
      everyone’s gone to sleep and I’ve heard all kinds of queer sounds, maybe
      they might be rats or the wind, but often and often, just as plain as I
      can hear your voice now, I’ve heard the sound of a violin like somebody
      was playin’. It give me an awful start when that man spoke of Bohm’s
      havin’ played the violin.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps somebody is playing,” I ventured, with a well remembered
      sensation of ice in the region of my spine. “The houses aren’t far away
      now; you could easily hear someone playing if the wind was in the right
      direction.”
    </p>
    <p>Mrs. Parker shook her head.</p>
    <p>
      “No, that ain’t it. There ain’t a violin in the country, and, besides,
      it’s too near; it’s like it came from here”—Mrs. Parker looked up at the
      bunkhouse door—“and none of Ethel’s plays.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing. I remembered too well hearing the strains of the violin as
      they used to float out through the silent night while old Bohm played to
      himself up there in the bunkhouse, hour after hour. I was troubled as the
      echoes of the past grew louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And then,” Mrs. Parker resumed, “there was that passage. I told you about
      that, didn’t I?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. Passage! What passage?” I turned to her in the moonlight which showed
      a puzzled frown between her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, the passage old Dad Patten found. I thought I’d told you about that,
      but maybe it was the year that you and Mr. Brook was away.” She paused a
      moment. “The third year after Ethel and John came here, John, he raised
      such a big crop of potatoes the cellar was plumb full, so he had Dad tear
      out some of the old bins under the bunk house to make some larger ones.
      Tom Lane was helpin’ him, and, of course, Tom was drunk. They’d tore out
      one or two, but when they come to the third, they found a deep hole behind
      it about four foot square. They stuck a spade into it, but it seemed to go
      back so far Dad he thought he’d investigate, so he begun to crawl into it
      to see how far it went. He was well in when Tom begun to laugh and act
      like he was goin’ to wall him up, so Dad backed out, for he said that he
      was afraid Tom was just drunk enough to do it. Dad said, though, that he
      went in the whole length of his body and stretched his arm out as far as
      he could, but didn’t touch nothin’, so he knew it went on further, and he
      said that it seemed to lead off in the direction of the old root cellar.”
    </p>
    <p>“Root cellar,” I repeated, too perturbed to say anything else.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Mrs. Parker, “but, you know, Dad, he’d never heard any of them
      stories about the root cellar; Dad’s too deaf to hear anything, so he
      didn’t think nothin’ about it except that it was some kind of an old
      dugout, and they went on and built the new bins, and about two months
      after John had got all his potatoes in Dad happened to say something about
      it. I was so beat I like to died, and when I told Dad what folks said
      about the old root cellar and Bohm, he turned as white as a sheet. You
      couldn’t get him up to the bunk house now if you was to drag him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don’t believe——” I began, then stopped as Mrs. Parker rose and put
      her hand on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Childy, I don’t know whether I believe them tales or not. I’ve scarcely
      been off this place since you went away ten years ago and I’ve seen and
      heard some mighty strange things. There’s lots of things in life we can’t
      explain—we just have to accept ’em, and that’s the way I’ve had to do
      here. Maybe there’s spirits and maybe there ain’t, but there’s some facts
      there’s no gettin’ ’round”—Mrs. Morton’s very words again—“but Dad’s
      findin’ that passage sure made me believe ’em more than I ever did before,
      and I do believe that some terrible things have been done right here on
      this dear old place, and that somewhere old Bohm’s spirit’s mighty
      restless.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb">
    <p>
      Owen and I sat up before the fire talking until late that night, for one
      of the buyers wanted the home place. It was hard to give it up, for we
      both loved it, but the old life had passed, and we were not a part of the
      new. Owen’s business kept him almost constantly in Denver, and we were at
      the ranch so little it seemed useless to cling to it longer. The most
      difficult decision had been made ten years before. This, in a way, was
      more simple, yet this was final; it meant the breaking of the last tie
      which bound us to those broad acres, and we were both silent a long time
      after we had agreed that it was best to let the old place go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I thought of my conversation with Mrs. Parker, and told Owen of
      the finding of the passage under the bunk house. He sat looking into the
      fire, and made no comment until I had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is strange, to say the least. I don’t suppose we shall ever know the
      real truth about it, but it doesn’t make much difference now; and if old
      Bohm’s spirit is wandering about here it will feel a little out of place
      in a cornfield.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It certainly will, but, Owen, don’t you hope ‘it’s mighty restless
      somewhere’?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed I do,” he laughed, and then grew serious again. “It’s been
      wonderful from first to last, our life here.” He sighed a little. “What
      experiences we’ve had!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, it has,” I said, getting up and standing by the fireplace, where
      Owen joined me. “It hasn’t always been easy, but I wouldn’t take anything
      for the things I’ve learned. I’m not the ‘Tenderfoot’ you brought out
      sixteen years ago; I’m a dyed-in-the-wool Westerner now. My whole view of
      life has changed. It has not only been a wonderful experience, Owen, but a
      wonderful privilege—to have lived here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word we watched the last log break apart. The glowing sparks
      lighted the room for a single instant, then died down, and in the fading
      light of the coals we turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I lay awake. Vivified by the thought of the final parting which
      was to come, our whole life on the ranch passed in review before me, the
      problems and the difficulties, the adjustments, the changed conditions and
      that disturbing sense of unsolved mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and stood by the window looking out upon a world of silver.
      Myriads of stars shone faintly in the heavens dimmed by the glory of the
      moon, the pale outline of the mountain was just visible, and, as on that
      first day when my heart was so heavy, I felt the sense of confusion give
      way to peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the vast spaces, under the guardianship of that commanding summit, we
      had gained a new sense of proportion, freedom from hampering trivialities
      and a broader vision of life and its responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there in the moonlight facing the mountain, I saw in it more than
      a symbol and source of strength; to me it had become indeed the abiding
      place of a God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back over the years, all the changes revealed only the evolution
      of a wondrous plan. We had launched our frail barque in the midst of the
      prairie sea at the ebb of the tide of the wild, lawless days of the West;
      with the flow we had been carried through the years of a well-ordered
      pastoral existence to the era of agricultural productivity, and on each
      succeeding wave we had seen civilization borne higher and higher toward
      the ultimate goal set by the Great Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>Ours had been, indeed, a wonderful experience.</p>
    <p class="center mtb0">THE END.</p>
